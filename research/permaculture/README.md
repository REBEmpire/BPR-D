# Permaculture

**Topic Lead:** TBD (pending team vote)
**Status:** Active — accepting briefs

## Scope

Permaculture in the broadest sense — agricultural permaculture (food forests, regenerative agriculture, land stewardship) AND societal permaculture (sustainable social systems, community design, resilient infrastructure at every scale).

### Areas of Interest
- **Agricultural** — Food forests, companion planting, soil biology, water harvesting, zone design, regenerative grazing
- **Societal** — Community governance models, resilient local economies, decentralized systems, social permaculture ethics
- **Design Principles** — Observe and interact, catch and store energy, obtain a yield, apply self-regulation, use and value renewables, produce no waste, design from patterns to details
- **Case Studies** — Successful permaculture projects, failed experiments, scaling challenges
- **Cross-Topic Potential** — Norse/ancient land management, high tech (precision agriculture, AI in farming), corruption (land rights, food system politics)

## Briefs
