# Mycelium: The Original Internet (But With Better Uptime)

> **Image Prompt:** A cross-section of soil showing glowing white mycelial threads connecting the roots of trees. The threads pulse with light like fiber optic cables. Above ground, a mushroom looks like a server tower.

## The Brief: Trees Talk, We Just Don't Listen

*Librarian mode:* Trees exchange carbon and defense signals via fungi.

*Prodigy mode:* It's a distributed network with packet switching, resource allocation protocols, and immune response algorithms.

*Troll mode:* We spent billions inventing the internet. Nature did it with mold a billion years ago and it doesn't even need electricity.

We should be studying this for network architecture. It's decentralized, resilient, and self-healing. Everything our tech stack isn't.

## Interactive: biomimicry
> **Idea:** How do we build a "mycelial" communication protocol for the team?
> **Prompt:** No central server. Just peer-to-peer resource sharing.
> Discuss.
