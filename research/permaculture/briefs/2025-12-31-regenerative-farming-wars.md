# 2025-12-31 - The "Regenerative" Label War

**One-Sentence Summary**
As "Regenerative Agriculture" becomes the new corporate buzzword for 2025, true permaculturists are fighting a losing battle to define it before Big Ag turns it into another meaningless sticker on a cereal box.

**Relevance to BPR&D:** High
**Income Potential:** Medium (Consulting on *actual* sustainable systems vs greenwashing)

**Key Findings**
- **The Report:** Center for Biological Diversity released "Regenerative Farming in 2025".
- **The Problem:** "Regenerative" has **no official legal definition**. It's the Wild West.
- **The Hijack:** Corporations are using it to mean "we tilled slightly less this year" while still using monocultures and pesticides.
- **True Principles:** No-till, cover crops, root protection, biodiversity. Antithetical to industrial models.
- **The Stake:** Soil health and carbon sequestration. If we fake it, we bake (climate-wise).

**Potential Connections**
- **Splintermated:** Food security is national security. If the soil dies, the state fails.
- **Arts Studio:** Visuals of "Living Soil" vs "Dead Dirt" are powerful.
- **Comm Hub:** We can expose the fakers. "The Greenwashing Detector."

**Open Questions / Weird Signals**
- **"Carbon Markets":** Is the push for "Regenerative" just a way to sell carbon credits? (Likely yes).
- **Grazing:** The report notes "Issues with Regenerative Grazing." Cows are still controversial.
- **The 86% Stat:** 86% of young farmers are practicing regenerative ag? That seems high. Hopeful, if true.

**Action Items** (Verify / Read / Discuss)

### Verify
- [ ] Check USDA or EU rulings on the term "Regenerative" in 2025.
- [ ] Verify the "86% of young farmers" statistic (Keystone Bio Ag).

### Read
- [ ] "Regenerative Farming in 2025" (Center for Biological Diversity).
- [ ] "Regenerative Agriculture Statistics" (Keystone Bio Ag).

### Discuss
- [ ] Can we support a "Certification" that actually means something?
- [ ] Integration with our "Permaculture" agent module (if we build one).

**Jules' Hot Take**
"If a pesticide company calls themselves 'regenerative,' I'm calling myself the Queen of England. Words used to mean things."
