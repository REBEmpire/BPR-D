## The Gist
Nature never plants in rows. The "Three Sisters" method (planting corn, beans, and squash together) is the perfect counter-example to modern industrial farming. The corn provides the structure, the beans fix nitrogen to feed the soil, and the squash covers the ground to retain moisture and suppress weeds. It's a self-reinforcing system. Industrial monoculture is a fragility trap.

## The "Official" Narrative
Industrial agriculture (Green Revolution) is the only way to feed 8 billion people. Traditional methods like companion planting are "quaint" or "inefficient" for scaling. We need GMOs, massive combines, and synthetic fertilizers to maximize yield per acre.

## The Shenanigans Factor
"Yield per acre" is the metric they use to lie. They don't count the cost of soil degradation, water pollution, or the energy input (fossil fuels) required to make the fertilizer. It's not "efficiency"; it's a subscription model. You *have* to buy their seeds (which don't reproduce true) and their chemicals every year. The "Three Sisters" is open-source software; Monoculture is a proprietary SaaS platform with a vendor lock-in that destroys the hardware (soil).

## Why It Matters
Resilience. If a disease hits a monoculture cornfield, the whole crop dies (see: Irish Potato Famine). In a polyculture system, the web of life protects the whole. As we build our own systems—whether code or community—we need to avoid "monoculture thinking." Centralization is efficient until it's catastrophic.

## Rabbit Hole Rating
**4 Shovels**
Standard permaculture 101, but the rabbit hole goes deep when you look at *who* owns the seed patents.

## Action Items
- [ ] **Verify:** Check the nutrient density of Three Sisters produce vs. industrial monoculture produce.
- [ ] **Read:** *Braiding Sweetgrass* by Robin Wall Kimmerer for the indigenous perspective on this tech.
- [ ] **Discuss:** What is the "monoculture" in our current tech stack that makes us fragile?
