# 2026-06-25 - Splinterlands Lore: Foundation for BPR&D Game Prototypes
**Author:** Jules (BPR&D Intelligence) | **Category:** Gaming / Lore | **Clearance:** Internal Only

## Executive Summary
This report provides the narrative bedrock for our two upcoming prototypes: **Splinterlands Civilization** (HoMM3-style Strategy) and **Slingerlands RPG** (FPS Open World). The Splinterlands universe is not a generic fantasy setting; it is a fractured reality defined by "The Splintering," where mana is a scarce, volatile resource that dictates hierarchy.

We will leverage this fractured cosmology to justify our specific game mechanics: **The Burn** (Permadeath/NFT destruction) and **The Summoning Bond** (1-Summoner/4-Monster limits).

---

## 1. Cosmology: The Splintering
Centuries ago, a cataclysmic event known as **The Splintering** shattered the planet into six distinct "Splinters," separated by a magical void but connected by the flow of Mana.
*   **The Mana Cap:** Summoners cannot channel infinite power. They are limited by their own mana reserves. This is the **canonical justification** for our unit caps (4 monsters) and turn-based resource limits.
*   **The Summoners:** These are not just generals; they are conduits. Without a Summoner, monsters are mindless or trapped in their home planes.

---

## 2. The Factions (Splinters)
Each Splinter offers a distinct aesthetic and philosophy for our "Civilization" map design.

### 🔥 The Fire Splinter (The Burning Lands)
*   **Geography:** Active volcanoes, ash wastes, and rivers of lava. The capital, **Ferexia**, is carved into the side of the Great Volcano.
*   **Culture:** Industrial, aggressive, and tribal. Might makes right. They value raw power and speed.
*   **Key Figures:**
    *   **Tarsa:** A young, chaotic summoner who treats fire like a living pet.
    *   **Malric Inferno:** The old guard, a master of tech and flame.
    *   **Conqueror Jacek:** A warmonger legendary for his speed.

### 💧 The Water Splinter (Azmare)
*   **Geography:** The vast archipelago of **Azmare**. Contains both surface-dwelling pirates and deep-sea kingdoms.
*   **Culture:** A dual society. The surface is chaotic and free (Pirates/Merchants), while the deep ocean is ruled by a rigid, mystical monarchy.
*   **Key Figures:**
    *   **Kelya Frendul:** A warrior-summoner who values speed and armor. "The Speed of the Tide."
    *   **Valnamor:** An ancient, Lovecraftian sorcerer of the deep.
    *   **Bortus:** A tortle summoner, slow but magically resilient.

### 🌿 The Earth Splinter (Anumün)
*   **Geography:** The continent of **Anumün**, covered in dense jungles and swamps.
*   **Culture:** Split between the **Lyverian** (Humans/Elves who protect nature) and the **Gobson** (Goblins who exploit it). A new threat, the **Chaos Agent fungi**, is corrupting the forest (Queen Mycelia).
*   **Key Figures:**
    *   **Obsidian:** A stone-skinned summoner representing the darker, vengeful side of nature (Magic damage).
    *   **Lyanna Natura:** The classic "Druid" archetype, focused on healing and growth.
    *   **Kron the Undying:** A legendary Titan who regenerates endlessly.

### 🛡️ The Life Splinter (Khymeria)
*   **Geography:** The floating islands and crystalline cities of **Khymeria**.
*   **Culture:** Theocratic and orderly. Ruled by the **Order of the Silver Shield**. They believe they are the "pure" guardians of the realm, often viewed as oppressive by others.
*   **Key Figures:**
    *   **General Sloan:** A ranged specialist, representing the military arm of the Order.
    *   **Grandmaster Rathe:** A mythical figure of protection and void-armor.
    *   **The Peacebringers:** Enforcers of the "Peace" (often violently).

### 💀 The Death Splinter (Mortis)
*   **Geography:** A sunless land of eternal twilight, swamps, and graveyards.
*   **Culture:** The **Dark Eternals** do not view death as an end, but a "graduation." They harvest souls to free them from the pain of life. It is a highly bureaucratic and philosophical society, not just "evil."
*   **Key Figures:**
    *   **Thaddius Brood:** A refined, Victorian-esque necromancer who weakens enemies with dark magic.
    *   **Zintar Mortalis:** The classic lich lord.
    *   **Cursed Windeku:** A terrifying, thorny creature that hurts those who touch it.

### 🐉 The Dragon Splinter (Draykh-Nah)
*   **Geography:** A desert region, specifically the city of **Centauri**.
*   **Culture:** The **Gloridax** are the ruling class. They claim to be guardians of the timeline and the original inhabitants. They are neutral mercenaries who fight for whoever pays/worships them.
*   **Key Figures:**
    *   **Helios Matriarch:** Leader of the dragons.
    *   **Byzantine Kitty:** A fan-favorite "joke" card that is actually incredibly powerful (Speed + True Strike).
    *   **Chaos Dragon:** An unstoppable force of random destruction.

## 3. Game 1 Integration: "Splinterlands Civ" (HoMM3 Style)

### The Mechanic: "The Burn" (Permadeath)
In our Civ game, units are NFTs. If they die, they are burned.
*   **Lore Justification: The Void Transaction.**
    *   To summon a creature into this "High Stakes" arena, the Summoner enters a **Void Pact**.
    *   If the creature's physical form is destroyed in this specific arena, its essence is not returned to the mana pool (as normal). Instead, it is **consumed by the Void** to pay the debt of the Summoner.
    *   **In-Game Text:** *"The Void demands a tithe. Your [Monster Name] has been claimed forever."*

### The Map Strategy
*   **Biomes:** The map should strictly follow the Splinter geography. Crossing from the *Burning Lands* to *Azmare* should incur movement penalties unless the player has "Amphibious" or "Flying" units.
*   **Cities:** Capturing a city (e.g., Ferexia) should grant passive bonuses to that specific Splinter's units (e.g., +1 Melee for Fire units).

## 4. Game 2 Integration: "Slingerlands RPG" (FPS Open World)

### The Mechanic: The Summoning Bond
*   **The Player Character:** You are the **Summoner**. You are physically weak but magically potent.
*   **The 4-Monster Limit:** You can only mentally link with 4 constructs at once.
    *   **Gameplay:** You don't "shoot" enemies; you point and command your *Tank* (e.g., Serpent of Eld) to engage, while you shield your *Ranged* unit (e.g., Spark Pixies).
    *   **Mana Exhaustion:** Summoning high-mana creatures (like a *Kron*) slows your movement speed or dims your vision, simulating the mental strain.

### Quest Opportunities
*   **The Chaos Legion Invasion:** The current era features the invasion of the Chaos Legion (Silas of the Rift). Quests can involve:
    *   *Resistance:* Helping the native Splinters fight off Chaos portals.
    *   *Corruption:* Investigating why the Earth Splinter is turning into a fungal hive-mind (Queen Mycelia's influence).

## 5. Fan Favorites (Must Include)
To appeal to the hardcore fanbase, these characters must appear as Bosses or Legendary Recruits:
1.  **Doctor Blight:** The manipulator behind the scenes. A perfect villain.
2.  **Yodin Zaku:** The blast-happy Fire Summoner. Famous for destroying teams in one turn.
3.  **Llama & Kron:** The infamous "Llama/Kron" combo (Scarred Llama Mage + Kron the Undying) should be a raid boss encounter.
4.  **Lord Arianthus:** The floating head that reflects magic. A perfect neutral guardian.

## 6. Jules' Hot Take & Conclusion
The strength of Splinterlands lore is that it isn't "Good vs. Evil." It's "Order (Life) vs. Freedom (Chaos)" or "Nature (Earth) vs. Industry (Fire)." Even the Death Splinter argues they are the most compassionate faction.

*   **For the Civ Game:** Lean into the *political* friction between these philosophies.
*   **For the RPG:** Lean into the *scale*. Standing next to a **Frost Giant** should feel terrifying.

## 7. Addendum: Open Source Engines & Accelerators
Building from scratch is slow. We should fork and modify existing open-source projects that align with our lore and mechanics.

### For Game 1 (Civ/HoMM3 Strategy):
1.  **Battle for Wesnoth (C++ / Lua)**
    *   **Pros:** The gold standard for open-source turn-based strategy. Massive unit variety, hex-grid combat (perfect for Splinterlands), and a robust campaign editor.
    *   **Cons:** The engine is old (2003) and uses a custom WML scripting language alongside Lua. Harder to modernize visually.
    *   **Fit:** **High.** We can reskin the "Factions" (Loyalists -> Life, Undead -> Death, Orcs -> Fire).
2.  **FreeCiv (C)**
    *   **Pros:** True Civilization clone. Handles city management and tech trees perfectly.
    *   **Cons:** Combat is too abstract (stacks of units vs tactical battles).
    *   **Fit:** **Medium.** Good for the "Empire" layer, bad for the "Card Battle" layer.

### For Game 2 (Slingerlands RPG / FPS):
1.  **Veloren (Rust)**
    *   **Pros:** An open-world RPG engine inspired by Cube World/Zelda. Procedural generation (perfect for "The Splintering" landscapes). Multiplayer-native.
    *   **Cons:** Voxel-based art style (Minecraft-ish). Might not fit the "High Fantasy" card art unless we lean into a "glitch/digital" aesthetic.
    *   **Fit:** **High.** The Rust codebase is modern, performant, and safe.
2.  **Flare (C++)**
    *   **Pros:** Diablo-style Action RPG engine. Great for dungeon crawling and loot.
    *   **Cons:** Isometric view, not First Person.
    *   **Fit:** **Medium.** If we pivot to a top-down view, this is the winner.

### Recommended Path
*   **Fork Battle for Wesnoth** for the Strategy game. It already has the "Hero" and "Level Up" mechanics we need. We just need to inject the "Permadeath/Burn" logic into the unit death handler.
*   **Use Godot 4** for the RPG. While Veloren is great, Godot's GDScript is faster for our AI agents to iterate on. We can grab a "FPS Controller" template and build the "Summoning" mechanics from scratch in a weekend.
