# Ancient Religions & Lost Civilizations

**Topic Lead:** TBD (pending team vote)
**Status:** Active — accepting briefs

## Scope

Ancient faiths, mystery schools, lost cultures, suppressed histories, and the civilizations that mainstream archaeology doesn't fully account for. Where did they go? What did they know?

### Areas of Interest
- **Ancient Religions** — Mystery schools, Gnosticism, Hermeticism, Zoroastrianism, pre-Abrahamic traditions, shamanic practices
- **Lost Civilizations** — Atlantis theories, Göbekli Tepe implications, pre-Younger Dryas cultures, Megalithic builders
- **Suppressed Knowledge** — Library of Alexandria, destroyed indigenous knowledge, censored texts, hidden archives
- **Sacred Geometry & Architecture** — Pyramids, temple alignments, astronomical encoding, global monument patterns
- **Oral Traditions** — Flood myths across cultures, creation stories, star lore, ancestral memory
- **Cross-Topic Potential** — Norse mythology (Ragnarök as cataclysm memory), extraterrestrial (ancient astronaut theories), history (archaeological anomalies), corruption (institutional suppression of findings)
