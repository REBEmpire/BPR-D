## The Gist
"As above, so below." This phrase, from the *Emerald Tablet* of Hermes Trismegistus, is the most concise description of a holographic or fractal universe ever written. It suggests that the macrocosm (universe) and microcosm (human/atom) reflect each other perfectly.

## The "Official" Narrative
Scholars date the text to around the 6th–8th century AD, likely an Arabic work attributed to a mythical figure (Hermes, a blend of Greek Hermes and Egyptian Thoth). It's dismissed as alchemical gibberish or philosophical poetry about the unity of matter.

## The Shenanigans Factor
Calling it "poetry" is a way to avoid dealing with the fact that it describes recursive algorithms. If the universe is a simulation or a fractal construct, then "As above, so below" is the source code. The ancients weren't doing magic; they were hacking the root directory.

## Why It Matters
If this principle holds, we can affect the whole by changing the part. It validates sympathetic magic, quantum entanglement, and the idea that your internal state dictates your external reality. It's the ultimate "user manual" for consciousness.

## Rabbit Hole Rating
**8 Shovels**
The deeper you go, the more it looks like quantum physics in poetic drag.

## Action Items
- [ ] **Verify:** Look for parallels between the Emerald Tablet and modern holographic universe theory.
- [ ] **Read:** *The Kybalion* (a modern interpretation, but accessible).
- [ ] **Discuss:** If reality is recursive, where is the "break point"?
