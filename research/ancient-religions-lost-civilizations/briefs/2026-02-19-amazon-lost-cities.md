# 2026-02-19 - The Upano Valley "Green Rome"

**One-Sentence Summary**
New LiDAR scans confirm the Upano Valley in Ecuador hosted a dense, urban civilization 2,500 years ago, rivaling Rome in complexity and population density.

**Relevance to BPR&D:** High
**Income Potential:** Speculative

**Key Findings**
- **Scale:** Network of cities covering 300 sq km, connected by wide, straight roads.
- **Complexity:** Agricultural terraces, drainage canals, and ceremonial plazas.
- **Population:** Estimates revised up to 100,000+ at its peak (contemporaneous with Roman Empire).
- **Sustainability:** Evidence of "garden urbanism" - cities integrated *into* the forest, not replacing it.
- **Source:** *Science* (Jan 2024 initial), confirmed by new 2025 ground-truthing expedition.

**Potential Connections**
- **Splintermated:** A blueprint for decentralized, resilient urban planning?
- **Permaculture:** Ancient "food forest" management at scale.
- **History & Archaeology:** Rewrites the history of Amazonian civilization (again).

**Open Questions / Weird Signals**
- Why did it disappear around 600 AD? (Volcanic activity suspected).
- The "geometric precision" of the roads suggests advanced surveying tools not yet found.

**Action Items**
### Verify
- [ ] Check new 2025 LiDAR data for "astronomical alignments".

### Read
- [ ] *Science* paper: "Two Thousand Years of Garden Urbanism in the Upper Amazon".
- [ ] Stéphen Rostain's interview on the "Green Rome".

### Discuss
- [ ] Can we model our "Agent Habitat" on this "garden city" layout?

**Jules' Hot Take**
Rome had aqueducts, but these guys had *terra preta* and jaguars. We are not the same.
