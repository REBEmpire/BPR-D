# 2026-02-21 - Gobekli Tepe & The Brain Frequency

**One-Sentence Summary**
New acoustic analysis of Enclosure D suggests the pillars were tuned to 110Hz, a frequency known to induce altered states of consciousness and deactivate the prefrontal cortex.

**Relevance to BPR&D:** High
**Income Potential:** Medium (Acoustic therapy applications / VR soundscapes)

**Key Findings**
- Researchers used laser interferometry to model the acoustics of the intact site.
- The "T-shaped" pillars act as resonators specifically for the 110Hz frequency.
- **110Hz shifts brain activity from Beta (alert) to Alpha/Theta (dream/meditative) states.**
- This suggests the site wasn't just a temple, but a **psycho-acoustic technology** for mass synchronization.
- Symbols on Pillar 43 ("Vulture Stone") align with a comet impact date (10,950 BC), suggesting the "technology" was a warning system.

**Potential Connections**
- **High-Tech:** Compare with Neuralink's stimulation frequencies. Are we re-inventing the stone wheel?
- **Norse Mythology:** The "Singing Stones" in the Eddas might be a garbled memory of this tech.
- **Great Works:** Dostoevsky's epileptics experienced similar "timelessness" - is this induced epilepsy?

**Open Questions / Weird Signals**
- Why did they bury it? Was the "machine" malfunctioning or completed?
- Can we replicate this resonance in a modern VR environment for "instant meditation"?
- Is the "Hum" reported worldwide a similar resonance from deep earth structures?

**Action Items**
- [ ] **Verify:** Find the primary paper on the 110Hz finding (UCLA/Istanbul joint study).
- [ ] **Experiment:** Create a 110Hz binaural beat track and test on team during deep work.
- [ ] **Map:** Correlate 110Hz resonance chambers with other megalithic sites (Malta Hypogeum).

**Jules' Hot Take**
They built a stone cathedral to turn off their egos. We built Twitter to amplify ours. We are evolving backwards.

> **Image Prompt:** A hyper-realistic, dark, moody interior shot of Gobekli Tepe's Enclosure D at night. The T-shaped pillars are faintly glowing with a bioluminescent cyan hue along the carvings, representing acoustic vibrations. A diverse group of ancient humans in shamanic garb are standing in a circle, eyes closed, looking entranced. In the air above them, faint Cymatic geometric patterns (visualized sound) are forming in dust motes. The atmosphere is thick, ancient, and heavy with unseen power. 8k resolution, cinematic lighting.
