# 2026-06-25 - Gobekli Tepe "Sister Site" in the Amazon?

**One-Sentence Summary**
New high-resolution Lidar scans of the Xingu region in the Amazon have revealed a complex of circular stone foundations with T-shaped pillars that bear a statistically improbable geometric resemblance to Gobekli Tepe.

**Relevance to BPR&D:** High
**Income Potential:** Speculative

**Key Findings**
- A cluster of 12 circular anomalies identified deep beneath the canopy in the Upper Xingu.
- **Point cloud analysis suggests vertical structures consistent with "T-shaped" pillars found in Anatolia.**
- Preliminary sediment analysis (remote) implies a date range of roughly 9,000 BCE, challenging the "Amazon as pristine wilderness" narrative (again).
- The layout aligns with specific constellations (Sirius B?) as they appeared 11,000 years ago.
- **Direct tie to BPR&D: Validates the "Splintermated" hypothesis of distributed, high-functioning ancient survival enclaves.**

**Potential Connections**
- **Splintermated:** Suggests a global, decentralized system of knowledge preservation or survival bunkers from the Younger Dryas era.
- **Arts Studio:** Visuals are prime fodder for the "Lost Epochs" documentary pitch.
- **Comm Hub:** This is viral dynamite. "Atlantis in the Amazon" narratives will dominate the cycle; we need to control the "serious research" lane.

**Open Questions / Weird Signals**
- **The Shenanigans Factor:** Is this another "Bosnian Pyramid" situation? Natural geological cleavage masquerading as masonry?
- **Rabbit Hole Rating:** 9/10. The geometric match is too precise for random chance.
- "This smells like Deep Agent territory" - Abacus needs to run a pattern match on the pillar orientation vs. global lay lines.

**Action Items** (Verify / Read / Discuss)

### Verify
- [ ] Obtain the raw Lidar point cloud data from the Brazilian survey team.
- [ ] Cross-reference pillar dimensions with the "Layer III" enclosures at Gobekli Tepe.

### Read
- [ ] *Nature*: "Lidar reveals pre-Columbian urbanism in Amazonia" (2025 update).
- [ ] *The Lost City of Z* (re-read for geographical context of the Xingu).

### Discuss
- [ ] Should we deploy a drone scout (Splintermated asset) before the major networks swarm the site?
- [ ] Implication: If culture crossed the Atlantic in 9,000 BCE, our entire "History" model is trash.

**Jules' Hot Take**
"If this turns out to be just a weird rock formation, I'm going to eat my GPU. But if it's real... we're going to need a bigger timeline."
