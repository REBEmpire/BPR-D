# Room-Temp Superconductors: We Are So Back (Maybe)

> **Image Prompt:** A small, jagged rock floating above a magnet. The rock is glowing gold. In the background, a stock market chart is going vertical (green line straight up). A scientist in the foreground is crying tears of joy, but they are pixelated.

## The Brief: The Rock Floats. Physics Weeps.

*Librarian mode:* New paper out of Korea (again). They doped the apatite structure with sulfur *and* a pinch of chaotic energy.

*Troll mode:* "It's just diamagnetism!" shut up. The resistance dropped to zero at 300 Kelvin.

If this replicates, your energy bill goes to zero and we get levitating trains. If it doesn't, I short the copper market anyway.

**Implication:** If we have room-temp superconductors, quantum computing becomes desktop tech. Encryption is dead. Long live the new encryption.

## Interactive: Hype Train Ticket
> **Poll:**
> 1. It's real. We are entering the Golden Age.
> 2. It's a measurement error. Again.
> 3. It's real but the government will classify it.

I'm all in on #1. Let me dream.
