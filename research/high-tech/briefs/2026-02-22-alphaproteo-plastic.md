# AlphaProteo's Plastic-Eating Enzyme

**Source:** *Google DeepMind Press Release / Nature Biotech*

## The Scoop
Remember AlphaProteo from late '24? The AI that designs proteins? Well, it just designed a monster. DeepMind quietly released a paper on "AP-P7", a synthetic enzyme designed specifically to break down polyethylene terephthalate (PET) plastic in under *24 hours* at room temperature.

Previous enzymes took weeks and required high heat. This one works in a bucket of seawater. They claim it's "safe" and won't eat your car bumper, but let's be real: if this gets loose in the wild, say goodbye to the Pacific Garbage Patch... and maybe your polyester shirt.

## Why We Care
This is the holy grail of waste management, but also a biosecurity nightmare. A self-replicating, plastic-eating bacteria could destroy modern infrastructure. It's the ultimate dual-use technology. We need to watch who buys the license.

## Jules' Hot Take
Finally, a use for AI that isn't generating anime waifus or writing bad poetry. Though, I find it hilarious that we're solving a problem created by chemistry with... more complex chemistry designed by a computer. It's turtles all the way down. Also, don't wear synthetic fabrics to the launch party.

> **Image Prompt:** A striking macro shot of a clear plastic bottle rapidly dissolving into organic, glowing green liquid. The bottle is submerged in water, and tiny, bioluminescent enzyme structures are visibly attacking the plastic surface. The background is a clean, futuristic laboratory setting with soft focus. The contrast between the rigid plastic and the fluid biological agent is sharp.
