# Extraterrestrial

**Topic Lead:** TBD (pending team vote)
**Status:** Active — accepting briefs

## Scope

Aliens, UFOs, contact theories, astrobiology, government disclosure, and the question of whether we're alone — approached with rigor and open-mindedness in equal measure.

### Areas of Interest
- **UFO/UAP Phenomena** — Historical sightings, military encounters, Congressional hearings, AARO reports, whistleblower testimony
- **Government Disclosure** — Declassified programs, FOIA documents, international disclosure movements
- **Contact Theories** — Fermi paradox, Drake equation, zoo hypothesis, simulation theory, interdimensional hypotheses
- **Astrobiology** — Extremophiles, exoplanet habitability, biosignatures, panspermia
- **Ancient Astronauts** — Serious analysis of the ancient astronaut hypothesis, separating signal from noise
- **Cultural Impact** — How contact (or its possibility) shapes society, religion, governance
- **Cross-Topic Potential** — Ancient religions (gods as visitors), corruption (government cover-ups), high tech (reverse engineering claims), history (suppressed encounters)
