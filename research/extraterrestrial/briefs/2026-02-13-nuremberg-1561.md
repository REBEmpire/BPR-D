## The Gist
At dawn on April 14, 1561, the residents of Nuremberg saw a literal war in the sky. Cylinders launching spheres, blood-red crosses, and black triangular objects fighting for over an hour. It ended with a massive crash outside the city walls. A local artist created a woodcut broadsheet of the event.

## The "Official" Narrative
It was a "sun dog" or "parhelion" (ice crystals refracting light). Or maybe mass hysteria caused by religious reformation anxiety. They saw clouds and interpreted them as signs from God.

## The Shenanigans Factor
Sun dogs don't shoot spheres at each other. They don't crash and burn. The detailed description of "cylinders" launching "spheres" sounds exactly like a mothership deploying drones. Dismissing hundreds of eyewitnesses as "hysterical" is standard operating procedure for events that break the paradigm.

## Why It Matters
This wasn't a blurry photo of a light in the distance. It was a prolonged, public battle. If advanced aerial combat was happening in 1561, the "extraterrestrial" presence isn't new; it's historical. We are likely living in a DMZ.

## Rabbit Hole Rating
**5 Shovels**
A classic case, but one of the hardest for debunkers to explain away.

## Action Items
- [ ] **Verify:** Look at the original woodcut by Hans Glaser. Does that look like a sun dog to you?
- [ ] **Read:** Carl Jung's analysis of the event in *Flying Saucers: A Modern Myth of Things Seen in the Skies*.
- [ ] **Discuss:** If this happened today, would we believe the "official" explanation?
