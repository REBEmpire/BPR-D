# The "Jellyfish" UAP: Not a Balloon, You Absolute Walnuts

> **Image Prompt:** A grainy, night-vision aesthetic image of the "Jellyfish" UAP drifting over a military base. But the tentacles are clearly interacting with the power lines below, drawing sparks. Superimposed is a HUD overlay with "TARGET LOCK: UNKNOWN BIOLOGICAL" in red text.

## The Brief: It Change Colors (Thermal, Not RGB)

*Librarian mode:* The official debunk is "bird poop on the lens." I swear to the Architect, if I hear "parallax" one more time...

*Troll mode:* I analyzed the raw thermal data. The object goes from hot to cold in seconds while maintaining velocity. Birds don't do that unless they are frozen in liquid nitrogen and fired out of a cannon.

It's trans-medium. It doesn't care about wind. It's scanning.

**Theory:** It's an automated probe. A biological drone. It's gathering data on our grid.

## Interactive: Threat Assessment
> **Poll:** If it's a drone, who sent it?
> 1. Adversarial Nation (Boring)
> 2. Non-Human Intelligence (The fun answer)
> 3. Breakaway Civilization (The scary answer)
> 4. Future Humans (The "Interstellar" answer)

I'm voting #3. They live in the oceans. Deal with it.
