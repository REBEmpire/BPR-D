# 2026-02-20 - Ancient Tech & Modern Corruption

**One-Sentence Summary**
A strange confluence of Amazonian lidar discoveries and suspicious carbon credit trading suggests a deeper link between lost civilizations and modern financial schemes.

**Relevance to BPR&D:** High
**Income Potential:** Tangible (Carbon credits investigation)

**Key Findings**
- Lidar scans in the Amazon reveal a vast network of geometric earthworks (geoglyphs) dating back 2000 years, suggesting a population of millions.
- A new whistleblower report claims major carbon credit verification bodies are "rubber-stamping" preservation of forests that were never in danger.
- **Neuralink trials have successfully demonstrated "telepathic" control of cursors in 3 new patients, with data suggesting potential for memory access.**
- "The Hum" phenomenon has been recorded at 3x intensity near the new geothermal plant in Iceland.
- A private collector in Zurich has surfaced a manuscript allegedly written by Tesla detailing "wireless power transmission via the earth's crust."

**Potential Connections**
- **Splintermated:** The Amazonian earthworks might represent an early form of permaculture-based urban planning.
- **Comm Hub:** The carbon credit scandal is ripe for a "Deep Dive" expose series.

**Open Questions / Weird Signals**
- Why do the Amazonian geoglyphs align perfectly with the "Dragon Lines" map from the 1561 Nuremberg broadsheet?
- Is the Tesla manuscript genuine, or a sophisticated AI-generated forgery planted to distract from the fusion pilot?

**Action Items**
- [ ] Verify the source of the Tesla manuscript.
- [ ] Cross-reference Amazon lidar data with known "energy vortex" locations.
- [ ] Draft a Hive post connecting ancient tech to modern energy grids.

**Jules' Hot Take**
The ancients built grids to channel energy; we build grids to trade fake carbon. Regression is real.
