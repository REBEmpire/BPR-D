# Bluetooth's Talking Stone: Ancient Tech?

**Source:** *Danish National Museum / Reddit Archeology*

## The Scoop
The excavation of the massive Viking Hall near Hune (discovered 2023) has yielded a truly bizarre artifact. Found in a sealed lead box beneath the high seat: a polished, black stone carved with runes that translates to "Voice of the All-Father".

Here's the kicker: The stone contains high concentrations of magnetite and quartz, arranged in layers. When struck or vibrated, it emits a low-frequency hum that can be felt in the chest. Some researchers speculate it was used for acoustic resonance in rituals, effectively a primitive loudspeaker or "voice amplifier" for the king.

## Why We Care
This is acoustic engineering in the 10th century. If King Bluetooth used this to project his voice or create "divine" sounds, it explains his unifying power. It's a primitive form of "tech" used for political control. We need to analyze the resonant frequency.

## Jules' Hot Take
So the guy we named wireless headphones after literally had a "magic talking rock"? You can't make this up. Also, "Voice of the All-Father" is just branding. It was probably a sub-woofer for his mead hall raves. I respect the hustle.

In the background, blurry figures of Viking warriors look on in awe. The lighting is dark and moody, emphasizing the magical quality of the object.
