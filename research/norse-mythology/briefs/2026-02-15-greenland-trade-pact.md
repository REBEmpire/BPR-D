# 2026-02-15 - Greenland's Hidden Century: The Viking-Inuit Trade Pact

**One-Sentence Summary**
Archaeological excavations in southern Greenland have uncovered definitive evidence of a centuries-long, formalized trade pact between Norse settlers and the indigenous Thule people, challenging the "collapse via conflict" narrative.

**Relevance to BPR&D:** Medium
**Income Potential:** None (Lore / Historical nuance)

**Key Findings**
- Runestones found *inside* Thule winter houses, used as tally sticks for trade.
- Walrus ivory carvings show a blend of Norse and Inuit artistic styles.
- Metal tools of Norse origin found in Thule sites dating to the 1400s (after the supposed "extinction").
- **Direct tie to BPR&D:** Offers a model for **Splintermated's** inter-faction diplomacy: trade creates stability where war creates ruins.

**Potential Connections**
- **Splintermated:** "The Merchant Victory." Economic interdependence as a survival strategy.
- **Arts Studio:** Visuals of Viking-Inuit hybrid culture. Fur and iron.
- **Comm Hub:** Narrative of "Cooperation in the Cold."
- **Cross-Pollination:** Connects to *History* (Migration) and *Ancient Religions* (Cultural exchange).

**Open Questions / Weird Signals**
- **The Shenanigans Factor:** Why did the church records stop? Maybe the Vikings "went native" and stopped paying tithes?
- **Rabbit Hole Rating:** 6/10. The "Lost Colony" didn't die; they just moved in with the neighbors.
- "This smells like Deep Agent territory" - History is written by the guys who stayed home (and wrote letters to the Pope).

**Action Items** (Verify / Read / Discuss)
*The depth of this topic warrants a corresponding number of action items.*

### Verify
- [ ] Verify the carbon dating of the mixed artifacts.
- [ ] Translate the runic inscriptions (are they contracts?).
- [ ] Check for genetic markers of Norse ancestry in modern Greenlandic populations.

### Read
- [ ] "The Thule-Norse Connection" (Antiquity, 2026).
- [ ] *Collapse* by Jared Diamond (to critique it).
- [ ] The Vinland Sagas (re-read for trade mentions).

### Discuss
- [ ] Does this refute the "Climate Collapse" theory? Or did they adapt *because* of it?
- [ ] How do we gamify "cultural assimilation" vs "conquest" in Splintermated?
- [ ] The ultimate survival hack: Make friends with the locals.

**Jules' Hot Take**
Vikings weren't just raiders; they were the first global capitalists. Trade beats raid every time. They didn't die out; they just stopped paying taxes.
