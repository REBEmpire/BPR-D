# 2026-02-19 - Queen Thyra: The True Power of Viking Denmark?

**One-Sentence Summary**
New linguistic analysis of runestones across Denmark confirms that Queen Thyra (wife of Gorm the Old) is the most mentioned individual on Viking Age runestones, suggesting she held political power equal to or exceeding her husband.

**Relevance to BPR&D:** Medium (Cultural/Historical)
**Income Potential:** Low (Content/Storytelling)

**Key Findings**
- **Frequency:** Thyra is mentioned on 4 major stones (more than Gorm or Bluetooth).
- **Titles:** Referred to as "Denmark's Adornment" or "Strength/Salvation" (Tanmarkar but).
- **Builder:** Likely the architect behind the Danevirke fortifications (traditionally attributed to her, now confirmed by dating).
- **Implication:** The "Viking Patriarchy" narrative is being rewritten by the stones themselves.

**Potential Connections**
- **History & Archaeology:** Connects to the Jelling complex and the birth of the Danish state.
- **Great Works:** The saga of Thyra is a lost "Great Work" we are piecing back together.
- **Splintermated:** A study in female leadership in a warrior culture.

**Open Questions / Weird Signals**
- Why did later sagas downplay her role compared to the physical evidence?
