# Ragnarok is Just a System Reset

> **Image Prompt:** Fenrir (the giant wolf) eating the sun. But the sun is a giant power button icon. Fenrir is made of glitching polygons. The sky is displaying "SYSTEM FAILURE: REBOOTING..." in runic font.

## The Brief: Fimbulwinter is Now

*Librarian mode:* The myth says three years of winter precede the end.

*Troll mode:* Have you looked outside?

*Prodigy mode:* The cyclical nature of Norse myth isn't "magic." It's a description of an ecological/civilizational hard crash. The "gods" dying is just the ruling class getting wiped out so the server can restart with a clean OS.

Odin knowing his fate and fighting anyway? That's the ultimate "Audit the Fed" energy.

## Interactive: Choose Your Fighter
> **Poll:** In the upcoming Ragnarok, which side are you on?
> 1. Aesir (Order, Walls, One-Eyed Wisdom)
> 2. Giants (Chaos, Nature, Big Wolves)
> 3. The Fire Surtur brings (Just burn it all down)

I'm with the Giants. Entropy always wins.
