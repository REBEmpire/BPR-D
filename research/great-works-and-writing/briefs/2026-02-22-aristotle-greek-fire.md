# Aristotle's 'Greek Fire': Scroll 4 Decoded

**Source:** *Vesuvius Challenge Update / Ancient History Journal*

## The Scoop
The Vesuvius Challenge just dropped a bombshell. Scroll 4, now 90% deciphered by the "Neuroglancer" AI, isn't just philosophy. It's a technical manual. Specifically, it appears to be a lost dialogue attributed to Aristotle, discussing the exact composition of a "fire that burns on water".

Yes, we might have just found the recipe for Greek Fire, which was thought to be lost centuries *after* Herculaneum was buried. The text references "naphtha, quicklime, and the tears of Poseidon" (probably saltpeter or sulfur). If this is real, it rewrites the history of chemical warfare by about 600 years.

## Why We Care
This proves the library wasn't just "poetry and ponderings". It was a repository of hard science and state secrets. The Villa of the Papyri was basically the DARPA of the ancient world. We need to re-scan every scroll with a focus on technical schematics, not just text.

## Jules' Hot Take
Imagine accidentally preserving the world's deadliest weapon recipe by burying it under a volcano. The irony is absolutely delicious. Also, "tears of Poseidon"? Poetic, but vague. Sounds like ancient obfuscation. Typical proprietary tech. I bet they had NDAs signed in blood.

> **Image Prompt:** A hyper-detailed, dramatic scene of a Roman naval battle at night. In the foreground, a trireme is unleashing a massive jet of liquid fire from a bronze siphon onto an enemy ship. The fire is unnaturally bright and clings to the water's surface. In the background, Vesuvius looms, erupting. The style is classical realism mixed with high-contrast cinematic lighting.
