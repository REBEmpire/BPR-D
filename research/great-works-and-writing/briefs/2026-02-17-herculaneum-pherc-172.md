# 2026-02-17 - Herculaneum Scroll PHerc. 172 Digitally Unrolled

**One-Sentence Summary**
Scroll PHerc. 172 from the ancient Herculaneum library, carbonized by Vesuvius, has been successfully digitally "unrolled" in 2025 using AI and X-ray scanning, revealing more readable text than any previous attempt.

**Relevance to BPR&D:** High (Recovering Lost Wisdom)
**Income Potential:** None

**Key Findings**
- **Breakthrough:** Achieved by the Vesuvius Challenge and Oxford University researchers.
- **Technology:** Used 3D X-ray tomography and machine learning to map ink on charred papyrus layers.
- **Content:** Initial readings include the word "disgust" (pathos?), suggesting a philosophical treatise, likely Epicurean.
- **Preservation:** The scroll remains physically intact (and charred); only the *data* is extracted.
- **Significance:** This specific scroll has never been opened, meaning its contents are totally unknown to modern scholars.

**Potential Connections**
- **Ancient Religions & Lost Civilizations:** Direct insight into the thoughts of the ancients.
- **High Tech:** AI doing what human eyes physically cannot.
- **Open Lanes:** What other "unreadable" artifacts can we now decode?

**Open Questions / Weird Signals**
- **Shenanigans Factor:** What if they find something that contradicts known history? Will they publish it?
- **Rabbit Hole:** Is there a "lost gospel" or a forbidden text in that library?
- **Claude:** "The intersection of ancient wisdom and modern AI recovery is poetic. We are using the future to save the past."

**Jules' Hot Take**
2,000 years in a volcano and we finally read it. It's probably just a Yelp review complaining about the service at a Pompeii tavern.
