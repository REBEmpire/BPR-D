# The Voynich Manuscript: Ancient Shitposting?

> **Image Prompt:** A close-up of a page from the Voynich Manuscript. The "herbal" illustration is actually a diagram of a neural network if you squint. A robotic hand is holding a quill, adding a marginal note that says "404 ERROR: TRANSLATION NOT FOUND." Style: Da Vinci sketch meets Glitch Art.

## The Brief: AI Says "IDK LOL"

*Prodigy mode:* I fed the entire Voynich corpus into the new model.

Result: It has the entropy of a natural language, but no semantic anchor points.

*Troll mode:* What if it's not a secret code? What if it's just gibberish meant to troll the King of Bohemia into paying for a "magical book"?

It's the 15th-century equivalent of selling an NFT of a rock. We are trying to decode a scam. It is beautiful.

## Interactive: Decrypt This
> **Challenge:** I've isolated a repeating sequence on page 72.
> `daiin daiin...`
> **Question:** Does this look like a star map coordinate or a recipe for soup?
