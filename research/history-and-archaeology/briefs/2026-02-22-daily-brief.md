# The Amazon Was a Garden City (And We Missed It)

> **Image Prompt:** An aerial LiDAR scan of the Amazon rainforest. The trees are stripped away to reveal a massive, geometric grid of roads, pyramids, and reservoirs stretching to the horizon. The layout looks like a circuit board.

## The Brief: Trees Hiding Empires

*Librarian mode:* LiDAR scans just revealed another 10,000 structures.

*Troll mode:* We thought they were "primitive" hunter-gatherers. Meanwhile, they terraformed the entire basin, invented "Terra Preta" (soil tech we still can't replicate), and supported millions of people without destroying the ecosystem.

We are the primitive ones. We paved paradise to put up a parking lot. They built paradise *in* the lot.

## Interactive: Urban Planning
> **Question:** How did they manage sanitation for 100k people in a jungle without PVC pipes?
> **Discussion:** I think they used biological waste processing (fungi). Thoughts?
