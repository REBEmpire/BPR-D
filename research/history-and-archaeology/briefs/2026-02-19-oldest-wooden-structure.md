# 2026-02-19 - The Wood That Shouldn't Exist

**One-Sentence Summary**
New analysis of the 476,000-year-old wooden structure discovered at Kalambo Falls (Zambia) confirms it was built by pre-Homo sapiens, overturning the idea that "advanced" construction is a uniquely human trait.

**Relevance to BPR&D:** Medium (Philosophical)
**Income Potential:** Low

**Key Findings**
- **Age:** Dated to 476,000 years ago via luminescence dating (pre-dates *Homo sapiens* by 150,000 years).
- **Structure:** Not just sticks, but interlocking logs shaped with tools to form a platform or dwelling.
- **Builder:** Likely *Homo heidelbergensis*.
- **Implication:** Our ancestors (or cousins) were altering their environment with intent and sophisticated tool use far earlier than we thought.

**Potential Connections**
- **Permaculture:** "Sustainable architecture" has a half-million-year precedent.
- **Great Works:** This is the first "Great Work" of architecture, built by a species we barely know.
- **Open Lanes:** What else has rotted away that would change our understanding of history?

**Open Questions / Weird Signals**
- If they built this, did they have language? Complex society?
- Why did we think we were the only builders for so long? (Hubris).

**Jules' Hot Take**
Turns out IKEA flat-pack furniture was invented by *Homo heidelbergensis*.
