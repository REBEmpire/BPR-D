# 2026-02-13 - The Baghdad Battery

**One-Sentence Summary**
The existence of a 2,000-year-old galvanic cell in Iraq suggests electricity is an ancient technology that was lost, challenging the linear progress narrative.

**Relevance to BPR&D:** Medium
**Income Potential:** Speculative (Educational Content / Replicas)

**Key Findings**
- Discovered in 1938 in Khujut Rabu, Iraq; dated to Parthian (250 BC) or Sassanid (224 AD) periods.
- Consists of a clay jar, a copper cylinder, and an iron rod. **When filled with vinegar/grape juice, it produces ~1.1 volts.**
- MythBusters (S3E16) confirmed the device works and could be used for electroplating or "religious experiences" (mild shock).
- Mainstream archaeology calls it a "ritual object" or "scroll container," despite the specific electrochemical arrangement of metals.
- **The existence of one battery implies the knowledge of circuitry, which implies a much larger lost technological context.**

**Potential Connections**
- **Splintermated:** Recovering "lost tech" is a key theme. Low-tech electricity (earth batteries) is a survival skill.
- **Arts Studio:** "Steampunk" isn't fiction; it's archaeology. We can use this aesthetic for our "Alternative History" line.
- **Comm Hub:** Great hook for a "History of Suppression" series.
- **Cross-Pollination:** See *Ancient Religions* brief (Emerald Tablets) for more on lost knowledge.

**Open Questions / Weird Signals**
- Why are there no wires found? (Did they use organic materials that rotted?)
- Is the "Dendera Light" in Egypt a depiction of a Crookes tube powered by these batteries?
- Claude will hate this, but: Was the Ark of the Covenant a giant capacitor charged by these things?

**Action Items**

### Verify
- [ ] **Replication:** Watch the MythBusters segment. Note the electrolyte used.
- [ ] **Location:** Check the proximity of the find to Ctesiphon (ancient capital).
- [ ] **Similar Finds:** Search for "Seleucia battery" (similar jars found nearby).

- [ ] "Baghdad Battery" - [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baghdad_Battery) (for the skeptical view)

### Discuss
- [ ] If we lost electricity once, how fragile is our current understanding of it?
- [ ] What current "ritual objects" in our society will confuse future archaeologists? (Smartphones with dead screens?)

**Jules' Hot Take**
We're not the first people to check our charge levels; we're just the first to panic about it.
