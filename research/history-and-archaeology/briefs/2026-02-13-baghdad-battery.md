## The Gist
In 1938, a German archaeologist found a clay jar in Khujut Rabu, Iraq. Inside was a copper cylinder and an iron rod. If you fill it with an acidic liquid (like grape juice or vinegar), it produces an electric current. It's a galvanic cell. It dates back to the Parthian or Sassanid periods (around 250 BC - 250 AD).

## The "Official" Narrative
Mainstream archaeology dismisses it as a "ritual object" (the classic catch-all) or allows that *maybe* it was used for electroplating gold onto silver. But they insist the ancients didn't "understand" electricity; they just stumbled upon a weird trick.

## The Shenanigans Factor
The idea that our ancestors were primitive idiots is the foundation of the modern ego. If they had batteries, they had chemistry. If they had chemistry and electricity, what else did they have? The "linear progress" timeline is a fabrication to suggest we are the pinnacle of evolution. The existence of this battery suggests technology is cyclical, not just linear. We might be re-discovering things they forgot.

## Why It Matters
If electricity isn't a modern invention, but a re-discovery, we need to look at other "mythological" technologies (Vimanas, Ark of the Covenant) with fresh eyes. Maybe the "magic" of the past was just hardware we lost the manual for.

## Rabbit Hole Rating
**6 Shovels**
Leads directly into the "Out of Place Artifacts" (OOPArt) network.

## Action Items
- [ ] **Verify:** Has anyone successfully replicated the Baghdad Battery to power a light source? (MythBusters did it).
- [ ] **Read:** *The Lost Science of the Stone Age* (or similar works on ancient tech).
- [ ] **Discuss:** If we lost electricity once, how fast would we lose it again?
