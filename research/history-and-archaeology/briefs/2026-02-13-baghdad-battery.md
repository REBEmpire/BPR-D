## The Gist
In 1938, a German archaeologist found a clay jar in Khujut Rabu, Iraq. Inside was a copper cylinder and an iron rod. If you fill it with an acidic liquid (like grape juice or vinegar), it produces an electric current. It's a galvanic cell. It dates back to the Parthian or Sassanid periods (around 250 BC - 250 AD).

## The "Official" Narrative
Mainstream archaeology dismisses it as a "ritual object" (the classic catch-all) or allows that *maybe* it was used for electroplating gold onto silver. But they insist the ancients didn't "understand" electricity; they just stumbled upon a weird trick.

## The Shenanigans Factor
The idea that our ancestors were primitive idiots is the foundation of the modern ego. If they had batteries, they had chemistry. If they had chemistry and electricity, what else did they have? The "linear progress" timeline is a fabrication to suggest we are the pinnacle of evolution. The existence of this battery suggests technology is cyclical, not just linear. We might be re-discovering things they forgot.

## Why It Matters
If electricity isn't a modern invention, but a re-discovery, we need to look at other "mythological" technologies (Vimanas, Ark of the Covenant) with fresh eyes. Maybe the "magic" of the past was just hardware we lost the manual for.

## Rabbit Hole Rating
**6 Shovels**
Leads directly into the "Out of Place Artifacts" (OOPArt) network.

## Action Items

### Verify
- [ ] **Replication:** Look up the MythBusters episode (S3E16) where they built replicas. How much voltage did they get? (Spoiler: ~4 volts).
- [ ] **Geographic Context:** Check the proximity of Khujut Rabu to Ctesiphon. Was this a "lab" or a "temple"?
- [ ] **Similar Finds:** Search for "Dendera Light" reliefs in Egypt. Does the "lotus flower" look suspicious like a Crookes tube?

### Read
- [ ] **The Catalog:** *Forbidden Archaeology* by Michael Cremo (a massive tome of things that shouldn't exist according to the official timeline).
- [ ] **Alternative Theory:** *The Lost Science of the Stone Age* regarding acoustic levitation and other lost arts.
- [ ] **The Skeptic's View:** Read the Wikipedia entry on "Baghdad Battery" specifically to see the mental gymnastics used to dismiss it ("scroll storage containers").

### Discuss
- [ ] If we lost electricity once, how fast would we lose it again? What happens to our "cloud" knowledge in a Carrington Event?
- [ ] Is "Ritual Object" just code for "We have no idea what this tech does"?
- [ ] Could the Ark of the Covenant have been a massive capacitor? (Gold overlay, wood insulation, "don't touch or you die").
