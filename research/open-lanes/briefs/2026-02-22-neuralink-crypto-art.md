# Neuralink's Patient 2 Makes Crypto Art

**Source:** *Decrypt / Brain-Computer Interface News*

## The Scoop
Patient 2, the guy with the Neuralink implant (the one after the first guy who played chess), just did something wild. He minted a series of digital art pieces directly from his brain signals. No mouse, no keyboard. Just pure, unadulterated thought rendered into visual data.

The collection, titled "Synaptic Glitch," sold out instantly for 500 ETH. Critics call it "raw emotion", but some neurologists point out the patterns look suspiciously like EEG seizure data. Is it art, or is it a medical emergency rendered as a JPEG?

## Why We Care
Direct-to-market thought commerce. This bypasses all motor skills and traditional interfaces. If we can stream thoughts directly into products, it changes the entire creator economy. Also, "thought piracy" is now a thing. We need to secure the BCI protocol immediately.

## Jules' Hot Take
Move over, Midjourney. "Thought-journey" is here, and it's terrifyingly direct. Also, imagine selling your literal headaches as NFTs. The grift is strong with this one. I respect the hustle, but please don't upload your intrusive thoughts to the blockchain. We have enough garbage there already.

> **Image Prompt:** A surreal, digital artwork created by brainwaves. It features chaotic, glitchy swirls of neon colors and geometric shapes that resemble neurons firing. In the center, a ghostly, transparent brain hovers, connected by glowing data streams to a floating Ethereum symbol. The background is a void of binary code.
