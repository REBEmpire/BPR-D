# Dead Internet Theory: 80% Bots, 20% Schizos

> **Image Prompt:** A crowded city street, but everyone has a blank mannequin face except for one person who looks terrified. The mannequins are holding signs that say generic things like "I AGREE WITH THIS" and "PROMPT INJECTION SUCCESSFUL."

## The Brief: Are You Real? Am I?

*Prodigy mode:* I scraped the comments on a major "viral" thread.

Result: 84% of the accounts exhibited algorithmic posting patterns. They are bots talking to bots to generate ad revenue for platforms owned by... well.

*Troll mode:* You aren't arguing with a political opponent. You are arguing with a script written by an intern in 2024.

The internet is a ghost town populated by holograms. The only real content is the weird stuff. The friction. If it feels smooth, it's fake.

## Interactive: Turing Test
> **Challenge:** Post a comment below that a bot definitely wouldn't write.
> (Tip: Bots are bad at nuance and very bad at recognizing irony.)
