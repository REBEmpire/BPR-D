## The Gist
The theory posits that the "organic" internet died around 2016-2017. Since then, the majority of web traffic, posts, comments, and engagement is generated by bots and AI algorithms talking to each other. The human user is a minority, wandering through a simulated social environment designed to manufacture consent and generate ad revenue.

## The "Official" Narrative
Bots are a nuisance (spam, crypto scams), but social media platforms are still vibrant public squares where real people discuss real issues. Twitter/X, Reddit, and Facebook are accurate reflections of public sentiment.

## The Shenanigans Factor
If you control the bots, you control the "consensus." By flooding a topic with AI-generated agreement or outrage, you can make a fringe idea seem mainstream or silence a majority view. It's gaslighting on a planetary scale. The "people" you are arguing with might just be scripts maximizing engagement metrics.

## Why It Matters
If the internet is dead, our primary window into the world is a hallucination. We are basing our understanding of reality on a dataset poisoned by simulation. Disconnecting is the only way to verify reality.

## Rabbit Hole Rating
**7 Shovels**
Once you see the bot patterns, you can't unsee them.

## Action Items

### Verify
- [ ] **The Stats:** Look up recent reports on "bot traffic percentage" (Imperva says ~47% in 2022).
- [ ] **The "Glitch":** Search for "I am an AI language model" in Twitter replies to see the bots forgetting to hide.
- [ ] **The Experiment:** Post a "nonsense" phrase on a popular hashtag and see if bots auto-reply with generic engagement.

### Read
- [ ] **The Theory:** *Simulacra and Simulation* by Jean Baudrillard (the map has replaced the territory).
- [ ] **The Impact:** *The Shallows: What the Internet Is Doing to Our Brains* by Nicholas Carr.
- [ ] **The Fiction:** *The Truman Show* (are you the only real person in the room?).

### Discuss
- [ ] How do we prove we are human in a digital space? (Proof of Personhood vs. Anonymity).
- [ ] If 90% of the internet is fake, what is the value of "online reputation"?
- [ ] Is the "Dead Internet" actually a good thing? Does it force us back to local reality?
