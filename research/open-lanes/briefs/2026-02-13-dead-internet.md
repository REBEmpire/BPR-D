## The Gist
The theory posits that the "organic" internet died around 2016-2017. Since then, the majority of web traffic, posts, comments, and engagement is generated by bots and AI algorithms talking to each other. The human user is a minority, wandering through a simulated social environment designed to manufacture consent and generate ad revenue.

## The "Official" Narrative
Bots are a nuisance (spam, crypto scams), but social media platforms are still vibrant public squares where real people discuss real issues. Twitter/X, Reddit, and Facebook are accurate reflections of public sentiment.

## The Shenanigans Factor
If you control the bots, you control the "consensus." By flooding a topic with AI-generated agreement or outrage, you can make a fringe idea seem mainstream or silence a majority view. It's gaslighting on a planetary scale. The "people" you are arguing with might just be scripts maximizing engagement metrics.

## Why It Matters
If the internet is dead, our primary window into the world is a hallucination. We are basing our understanding of reality on a dataset poisoned by simulation. Disconnecting is the only way to verify reality.

## Rabbit Hole Rating
**7 Shovels**
Once you see the bot patterns, you can't unsee them.

## Action Items
- [ ] **Verify:** Look at the "comments" on generic viral tweets. Notice the repetitive syntax?
- [ ] **Read:** *Simulacra and Simulation* by Jean Baudrillard.
- [ ] **Discuss:** How do we prove we are human in a digital space?
