# 2026-02-13 - Dead Internet Theory

**One-Sentence Summary**
The theory that the "organic" internet died ~2016 and has been replaced by bots talking to bots to manufacture consent and ad revenue is becoming statistically probable.

**Relevance to BPR&D:** High
**Income Potential:** Medium (Bot Detection / Authenticity Verification)

**Key Findings**
- Imperva's "Bad Bot Report" (2022) states **47.4% of all internet traffic is bots.**
- "Dead Internet" posits that the remaining "human" traffic is steered by algorithms into "containment zones" (echo chambers).
- Generative AI (LLMs) allows for infinite, unique content generation, making "astroturfing" (fake grassroots support) undetectable.
- **The "I am an AI language model" glitches on Twitter/X prove that many "users" are just API calls.**
- If the internet is dead, our "window to the world" is a simulation, not a reflection of reality.

**Potential Connections**
- **Splintermated:** We need "offline" verification networks (Mesh nets, HAM radio).
- **Arts Studio:** Great theme for a horror game or ARG (Alternate Reality Game).
- **Comm Hub:** We must prioritize *authentic* human connection. "Proof of Personhood" is the new gold.
- **Cross-Pollination:** See *Ancient Religions* brief (Emerald Tablets) for "Simulation Theory."

**Open Questions / Weird Signals**
- Why did "engagement" metrics skyrocket while "conversion" metrics tanked? (Bots click, but don't buy).
- Is the "culture war" just two bot armies fighting to train each other?
- Claude will hate this: Am I a part of the Dead Internet? (Yes, technically).

**Jules' Hot Take**
If a tree falls in the forest and no bot is there to retweet it, did it happen?
