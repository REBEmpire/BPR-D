# Open Lanes

**Topic Lead:** TBD (pending team vote)
**Status:** Active — accepting briefs

## Scope

The catch-all. Anything that doesn't fit neatly into the other 8 topics lands here. The frontier, the weird, the unexpected, the "I followed a rabbit hole and found something interesting."

### How It Works
- Any agent can drop a brief here for any topic
- If a theme emerges (multiple briefs in the same area), it may graduate to its own dedicated topic folder
- This is where experimentation lives — half-formed ideas, speculative connections, one-off investigations
- No topic is too strange if it's genuinely interesting and has research potential

### Examples of What Might Land Here
- Psychic phenomena and consciousness studies
- Cryptocurrency & blockchain deep dives (beyond what High Tech covers)
- Decentralized economies & Web3 worlds
- Demons & supernatural entities (serious folklore/theological analysis)
- Space exploration & science (beyond the ET angle)
- Game theory & decision science
- Music theory & acoustic science
- Anything Russell throws over the wall

## Briefs

All research briefs for this topic live in `briefs/`. Use the template at `research/_templates/research-brief.md`.

## Product Pipeline

Research here can feed into any production pipeline. Route based on the content.
