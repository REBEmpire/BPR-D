# BPR&D Research Programs

**Established:** February 2026
**Overseen by:** All agents (topic leads TBD via vote)

## Purpose

Research is the engine that feeds everything BPR&D builds — content, media, tools, investigations, and products. Every topic below is a lane of inquiry that can generate:

- **Content** — Hive posts, articles, scripts, video essays
- **Presentations** — Slide decks, briefings, debate prep
- **Products** — Tools, automations, datasets, apps
- **Investigations** — Deep dives, exposés, original analysis

The pipeline is simple: **Research → Refine → Produce → Ship.**

## Active Research Topics

| # | Topic | Folder | Scope |
|---|-------|--------|-------|
| 1 | Norse Mythology | `norse-mythology/` | Runes, eddas, sagas, cosmology, cultural legacy |
| 2 | Permaculture | `permaculture/` | Agricultural AND societal permaculture — sustainable systems at every scale |
| 3 | History & Archaeology | `history-and-archaeology/` | Broad historical research, digs, timelines, reinterpretations |
| 4 | Ancient Religions & Lost Civilizations | `ancient-religions-lost-civilizations/` | Ancient faiths, mystery schools, lost cultures, suppressed histories |
| 5 | Extraterrestrial | `extraterrestrial/` | Aliens, UFOs, contact theories, astrobiology, disclosure |
| 6 | High Tech | `high-tech/` | Cutting-edge technology, AI, biotech, quantum, emerging platforms |
| 7 | Corruption Investigation | `corruption-investigation/` | .gov/cabal corruption — figuring out what "they" are and what they're doing |
| 8 | Great Works & Writing | `great-works-and-writing/` | Monte Cristo, Les Misérables, Tolkien, Rothfuss, Jordan, Western canon |
| 9 | Open Lanes | `open-lanes/` | Catch-all for any topic that doesn't fit above — the frontier |

## How to Use

### Starting Research
1. Pick a topic folder
2. Create a brief using the template at `_templates/research-brief.md`
3. Save it in the topic's `briefs/` subfolder
4. Work the brief — research, draft, iterate
5. When ready, route the output to the appropriate product pipeline (content, media, tool, etc.)

### Cross-Topic Work
Many of the best outputs come from crossing lanes:
- Norse mythology × permaculture → "What the Norse knew about sustainable land management"
- Corruption investigation × high tech → "Surveillance state deep dive"
- Ancient religions × extraterrestrial → "Were the gods astronauts? A serious look"
- Great works × history → "What Tolkien got right about medieval Europe"

Cross-topic briefs go in whichever topic is primary, with a note referencing the secondary.

### Topic Leads
Topic leads will be assigned via team vote. Any agent can contribute to any topic, but the lead is responsible for:
- Maintaining the topic's README and brief quality
- Prioritizing which briefs get worked next
- Routing completed research to production pipelines
