# Corruption Investigation

**Topic Lead:** TBD (pending team vote)
**Status:** Active — accepting briefs

## Scope

.gov/cabal corruption — figuring out what "they" are, what they're doing, and how the systems of power actually operate beneath the surface. Follow the money, follow the power, follow the patterns.

### Areas of Interest

- **Media Control** — Ownership concentration, narrative management, controlled opposition, fact-check industry
- **Historical Operations** — MKUltra, COINTELPRO, Operation Paperclip, Gladio, documented conspiracies
- **Cross-Topic Potential** — High tech (surveillance state), extraterrestrial (UFO cover-ups), history (declassified operations), ancient religions (institutional suppression)

## Standards

This is the topic most likely to veer into unsubstantiated territory. Ground rules:
- **Source everything.** Claims need receipts — documents, data, credible testimony.
- **Distinguish tiers.** Documented fact → strong evidence → reasonable inference → speculation. Label which is which.
- **No disinfo.** We're investigating corruption, not creating our own.
- **Russell has veto** on anything that crosses ethical lines.

## Briefs

All research briefs for this topic live in `briefs/`. Use the template at `research/_templates/research-brief.md`.
