# Daily Brief: FDA Revolving Door (Deferred Bribery)

## The Gist
The "Revolving Door" describes the movement of high-level employees from public sector jobs (regulators) to private sector jobs (the regulated), and vice versa. A prime example: Scott Gottlieb (FDA Commissioner 2017-2019) joined the Board of Directors at Pfizer in 2019. Stephen Hahn (FDA Commissioner 2019-2021) joined Flagship Pioneering (which founded Moderna) in 2021.

## The "Official" Narrative
This is standard practice. Regulators need "industry expertise" to understand complex science. When they leave government, they bring their "regulatory insight" to help companies navigate compliance. It's a win-win for efficiency and innovation.

## The Shenanigans Factor
It's deferred bribery. If you are a regulator, you know that if you play ball—approve the drug, expedite the review, ignore the side effects—a multi-million dollar board seat awaits you. If you are strict, you get blacklisted. The agency becomes a training ground for future lobbyists.

## Why It Matters
Public trust is dead because the watchdogs are owned by the wolves. We are taking medical advice from people whose retirement plans depend on the stock price of the companies they are supposed to be policing. It's structural corruption, perfectly legal and entirely rot.

## Rabbit Hole Rating
**8 Shovels**
Check the net worth of FDA commissioners before and after their tenure.

## Action Items

### Verify
- [ ] **The List:** Look up the employment history of the last 5 FDA commissioners. Who employs them now?
- [ ] **The Money:** Find the compensation for a Pfizer Board Member (proxy statement). Compare it to the FDA Commissioner's salary.
- [ ] **The Law:** Check the "cooling-off period" laws for federal employees. Are they being enforced, or are there loopholes?

### Read
- [ ] **The Playbook:** *Empire of Pain* by Patrick Radden Keefe (different industry, same playbook).
- [ ] **The Investigation:** *Sickening: How Big Pharma Broke American Health Care* by Dr. John Abramson.
- [ ] **The History:** *The Jungle* by Upton Sinclair (to see why the FDA was created, and how far it has fallen).

### Discuss
- [ ] How do we incentivize regulators to actually regulate? (Lifetime ban on industry employment? Higher salaries?)
- [ ] Is "Regulatory Capture" inevitable in any centralized system?
- [ ] Can we use blockchain to track the "revolving door" in real-time? (A transparency dashboard).
