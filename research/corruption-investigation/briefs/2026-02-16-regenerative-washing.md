# 2026-02-16 - Regenerative Washing: The New Greenwashing Frontier

**One-Sentence Summary**
A new report exposes how major agribusiness giants are co-opting the term "Regenerative Agriculture" without defining it, effectively greenwashing industrial monocultures.

**Relevance to BPR&D:** High
**Income Potential:** Medium (Consulting on *actual* regenerative standards / "Truth in Labeling" tools)

**Key Findings**
- The **Center for Biological Diversity** released a scathing report on the state of "Regenerative Farming" in 2025.
- Key finding: The term has **no official legal definition**, allowing companies like ADM and Cargill to claim "5 million regenerative acres" based on minimal practices like "reduced tillage" while still using heavy pesticides.
- True regenerative practices (no-till, cover cropping, animal integration) are being watered down to "carbon intensity scores."
- **Tie to BPR&D:** Directly impacts our *Permaculture* research and *Splintermated* resource management models.

**Potential Connections**
- **Splintermated:** Demonstrates how systems capture and dilute revolutionary concepts to maintain the status quo.
- **Arts Studio:** "The Green Facade" – a visual theme for corporate dystopia zones.
- **Comm Hub:** A "Real vs. Fake" regenerative guide would be high-value content.
- **Cross-Pollination:** Connects to *Corruption Investigation* (Lobbying) and *Permaculture* (Actual techniques).

**Open Questions / Weird Signals**
- **The Shenanigans Factor:** The aggressive push to monetize "soil carbon" without verifying soil health.
- **Rabbit Hole Rating:** 7/10. Who is writing the certification standards? (Hint: It's the lobbyists).
- "Claude will hate this assumption" - That all corporate efforts are inherently malicious. (But they usually are).

**Action Items** (Verify / Read / Discuss)
*The depth of this topic warrants a corresponding number of action items.*

### Verify
- [ ] Look up the board members of the "Regenerative Organic Alliance" vs the "Regenerative Agriculture Coalition" (corporate front?).
- [ ] Check ADM's 2025 Sustainability Report for their definition of "regenerative."
- [ ] Investigate the USDA's stance on defining the term.

### Read
- [ ] *Regenerative Farming in 2025* - Center for Biological Diversity.
- [ ] *The Soil Will Save Us* (for baseline comparison).
- [ ] *Merchants of Doubt* (classic playbook on industry obfuscation).

### Discuss
- [ ] How do we ensure our own "permaculture" projects aren't just greenwashed landscaping?
- [ ] Can we build a "BPR&D Certified" standard for our community?
- [ ] Is "Regenerative" a burned term? Should we pivot to "Restoration Ecology"?

**Jules' Hot Take**
If you're spraying Roundup on your "regenerative" corn, you're not regenerating anything but your quarterly profits.
