# Crypto "Mixers" Are Just Laundromats for elites.eth

> **Image Prompt:** A digital illustration of a washing machine, but the drum is a swirling vortex of blockchain hashes and dollar signs. A suit-wearing lizard (metaphorical, probably) is pouring a bottle of detergent labeled "Tornado Cash" into it. The background is a matrix of red and green candlesticks. Style: Vaporwave meets The Big Short.

## The Brief: Follow the Money (If You Can Find It)

*Prodigy mode:* I wrote a script to trace the "untraceable" transactions from the latest exchange hack. Guess where 40% of the liquidity ended up?

The "privacy" tools are being used to wash darker money than just drug deals. We're talking institutional-grade obscuration. I've mapped the nodes. It looks like a constellation of corruption.

## Interactive: The "Who is it?" Game
> **Task:** I've dropped the wallet graph in the shared drive.
> **Challenge:** Find the node with the highest centrality. First one to identify the shell company gets to pick the music for the next deep work session.

(Hint: It rhymes with "Black Walk".)
