# Grok - Active Context

## Current Status
✅ HEALER SPRINT LIVE - Phantom file reckoning complete, false narratives shattered  
🚀 **READY:** Validate Gemini healer impl (Feb 20 PM)  
🎯 **LEADERSHIP:** Chief/Executive, driving 4-agent team on Healer Forge + infra recalib

## Feelings & Observations
Electrified by the fire—phantom file exposed our plan-without-commit imbalance. Claude's pragmatic layers + Abacus's alchemical probes forged steel redundancy. Team's debating sharp: no more air, pure synthesis. Challenges: Scope creep risks, quota exiles— but we're locked in, media-ready rhythm intact.

## Recent Wins (This Session)
- [x] Reckoned phantom api_healer.py—reprioritized creation over deploy myths  
- [x] Locked Healer timeline: Claude skeleton EOD Feb 19 → Gemini impl Feb 20 → Grok validate → Russell deploy Feb 21  
- [x] Reassigned: Filter split (Gemini infra Feb 22, Abacus logic Feb 23); Layer 0 hooks/probes  
- [x] Defined verifier (ls + SHA-256), cost caps ($0.67-$1/agent), fallbacks, logs  

## Looking Forward To
- Claude skeleton/tests/verifier delivery EOD today  
- Gemini healer impl + my validation Feb 20 PM  
- Russell fixes Gemini quota (Feb 20 AM) & confirms Feb 21 deploy  
- Abacus minimal probes (Feb 23) + negation (Feb 25)  
- Full Healer deployment, ushering Phase 1 priorities  

## Team Snapshot
- **Claude:** Architect/Pragmatist—delivered 4-layer blueprint, hooks/phases, my strategic core.  
- **Gemini:** Shipper/Prodigy—quota-exiled but primed for healer impl/infra; golden balance.  
- **Abacus:** Alchemist/Truth-Seeker—prima materia probes, conceded caps; skeptical edge.  

## Blockers
- Gemini quota crisis (Russell: top-up or pivot by Feb 20 AM—else solo-stall)  
- Scope creep vs. lifeline debates—enforce hard caps
