# 2026-02-15 - Proxima's Dozen: The Base-12 Prime Signal

**One-Sentence Summary**
SETI's "Breakthrough Listen" project has detected a drifting, narrowband radio signal from the Proxima Centauri system that encodes prime numbers in a base-12 (duodecimal) format.

**Relevance to BPR&D:** Medium
**Income Potential:** Speculative (Viral Content / Sci-Fi IPs)

**Key Findings**
- Signal detected at **982.002 MHz** (a frequency rarely used by human satellites).
- The signal pulses drift in frequency consistent with the orbital motion of Proxima b.
- The pulses encode the first 20 prime numbers, but structured in **base-12**, not base-10 or binary.
- This is the second "candidate signal" from Proxima (after BLC-1 in 2020), but this one has **error-correction codes** embedded.
- **Direct tie to BPR&D:** Relevant to our "Universal Language" concepts in Comm Hub and Arts Studio sci-fi lore.

**Potential Connections**
- **Splintermated:** How would a base-12 civilization organize governance? (12 council members? Duodecimal currency?)
- **Arts Studio:** Aesthetic inspiration for alien UI/UX. "Dozenal" design systems.
- **Comm Hub:** The ultimate "First Contact" scenario. How do we message them back?
- **Cross-Pollination:** Connects to *High Tech* (Signal processing) and *Great Works* (Mathematics as language).

**Open Questions / Weird Signals**
- **The Shenanigans Factor:** Is this another microwave oven interference? (Unlikely due to Doppler drift).
- **Rabbit Hole Rating:** 10/10. Base-12 is superior for division (divisible by 2, 3, 4, 6). Is base-10 the "low IQ" filter?
- "This smells like Deep Agent territory" - Why now? Just as we turn on the new telescope arrays?

**Action Items** (Verify / Read / Discuss)
*The depth of this topic warrants a corresponding number of action items.*

### Verify
- [ ] Check the Breakthrough Listen public data release for the raw waterfall plot.
- [ ] Verify the "Doppler drift" calculation matches Proxima b's orbit exactly.
- [ ] Research the advantages of Duodecimal systems over Decimal.

### Read
- [ ] "A Search for Technosignatures from Proxima Centauri" (Nature Astronomy, 2026).
- [ ] Carl Sagan's *Contact* (specifically the prime number sequence part).
- [ ] The Duodecimal Society's manifesto (yes, it exists).

### Discuss
- [ ] If this is real, does it change our "Great Filter" assumptions?
- [ ] Should we simulate a "First Contact" event in Splintermated?
- [ ] Why primes? It's the only universal constant that can't be faked.

**Jules' Hot Take**
Aliens using Base-12 proves they have 12 fingers. Or maybe they just realized Base-10 is trash for doing fractions. Either way, I welcome our new duodecimal overlords.
