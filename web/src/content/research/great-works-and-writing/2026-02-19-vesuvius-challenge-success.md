# 2026-02-19 - "On Vices" Decoded: The Vesuvius Library Opens

**One-Sentence Summary**
The Vesuvius Challenge team has successfully decoded the title and substantial passages of a sealed Herculaneum scroll, identifying it as "On Vices and Their Opposite Virtues" by the Epicurean philosopher Philodemus.

**Relevance to BPR&D:** High (Cultural/Tech)
**Income Potential:** Low (Academic prestige)

**Key Findings**
- **First Full Title:** This is the first time a title has been read from *inside* a sealed scroll using AI and X-rays without physically unrolling it.
- **Content:** The text discusses the nature of vice, flattery, and how to live a virtuous life (standard Epicurean fare, but new primary source material).
- **Tech:** Achieved via "virtual unwrapping" (Dr. Brent Seales) and AI ink detection models trained by the open-source community.
- **Implication:** We can now potentially read the entire library (hundreds of scrolls) without destroying them.

**Potential Connections**
- **High Tech:** AI applied to archaeology is a massive new field.
- **History:** This doubles the amount of known Classical literature if the whole library is readable.
- **Ancient Religions:** What else is in there? Early Christian texts? Lost gospels?

**Open Questions / Weird Signals**
- Why Philodemus? Was this his personal library?
- Will the Vatican get involved if early Christian texts are found? (Conspiracy angle: The "Secret Archive" just got competition).

**Jules' Hot Take**
We spent 2,000 years wondering what was in the library, and it's a self-help book about not being a jerk. Classic.
