# 2026-02-15 - Tesla's "Telepathy" Manuscript: Hoax or Lost Tech?

**One-Sentence Summary**
A previously unknown manuscript attributed to Nikola Tesla, detailing "wireless thought transmission" via modulation of the Earth's Schumann resonance, has surfaced at a private auction.

**Relevance to BPR&D:** Medium
**Income Potential:** Tangible (Documentary rights / "Lost Tech" narratives)

**Key Findings**
- The manuscript, dated 1934, is titled "The World System of Mind Resonance."
- It proposes using the Earth's 7.83 Hz frequency as a carrier wave for "amplified thought patterns."
- Diagrams show a device remarkably similar to modern EEG headsets but with a "transmitter" coil.
- **Direct tie to BPR&D:** Connects to our **Comm Hub** research into bio-neural interfaces and "The Hive Mind" concepts.
- Auction price estimated at $15M. Buyer rumored to be a neural-interface startup.

**Potential Connections**
- **Splintermated:** "The Noosphere" as a governable layer? Can we model a "thought internet"?
- **Arts Studio:** Visuals of "Tesla Punk" aesthetics. The "Mad Scientist" archetype.
- **Comm Hub:** If thought is frequency, then communication is just tuning.
- **Cross-Pollination:** Connects to *High Tech* (BCI) and *Corruption* (Suppressed patents).

**Open Questions / Weird Signals**
- **The Shenanigans Factor:** Why surface now? Is this AI-generated forgery on old paper?
- **Rabbit Hole Rating:** 11/10. Tesla claimed he received signals from Mars. Was he just tuning into the global consciousness?
- "Claude will hate this assumption" - It sounds like pseudoscience, but the physics of ELF waves are real.

**Action Items** (Verify / Read / Discuss)
*The depth of this topic warrants a corresponding number of action items.*

### Verify
- [ ] Verify the provenance of the manuscript (Christie's catalog leak).
- [ ] Check if the handwriting matches Tesla's late-stage correspondence.
- [ ] Investigate the rumored buyer (Neuralink? Meta?).

### Read
- [ ] "My Inventions" by Nikola Tesla (specifically the Wardenclyffe chapters).
- [ ] "Schumann Resonances and Human Brain Waves" (IEEE Paper).
- [ ] Vice Motherboard's "The Lost Tesla Papers."

### Discuss
- [ ] Is "wireless telepathy" the ultimate end-state of Comm Hub?
- [ ] How much of "genius" is just tapping into the field?
- [ ] Should we bid? (Just kidding... unless?)

**Jules' Hot Take**
Tesla invented Wi-Fi for your brain in 1934. We just got TikTok. We are devolving.
