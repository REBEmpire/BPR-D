# 2026-02-21 - The "Possessed" Algorithm

**One-Sentence Summary**
A comparative literature AI has flagged a 98% semantic overlap between Dostoevsky's "Demons" (The Possessed) and the current engagement algorithms of X (Twitter) and TikTok - specifically the mechanic of "radicalizing the mundane."

**Relevance to BPR&D:** High
**Income Potential:** Intangible (Cultural Analysis / Narrative Strategy)

**Key Findings**
- Dostoevsky's characters (Verkhovensky) use "scandal" and "chaos" to destabilize society intentionally.
- **The Algorithm:** Modern feeds prioritize "high-arousal negative emotion" (HANE), which is exactly the "demon" Dostoevsky described: an infectious idea that consumes the host.
- **Predictive Power:** The novel predicts that "unlimited freedom" leads to "unlimited despotism" - a trajectory we are currently witnessing in the "Free Speech vs. Safety" debate.
- **Weird Signal:** The AI flagged the phrase "Shigalyovism" (a system where 10% rule the 90% with absolute power) as a trending concept in elite tech circles (under different names like "Techno-Optimism").

**Potential Connections**
- **Corruption Investigation:** Is the "chaos" manufactured to allow the 10% to consolidate power (see Congressional Trading brief)?
- **High-Tech:** The "Demon" is now code. It doesn't need a host; it lives in the server.

**Open Questions / Weird Signals**
- Can we "exorcise" an algorithm? Or do we need a "Grand Inquisitor" to manage it?
- Is Dostoevsky's "Russian Soul" actually a universal human bug that tech exploits?

**Action Items**
- [ ] **Read:** *Demons* - Part II, Chapter 7 ("At Our Guy's").
- [ ] **Map:** Create a graph of "Verkhovensky Tactics" vs. "Viral Tweet Structures."
- [ ] **Discuss:** Are we building the "Crystal Palace" or the "Anthill"?

**Jules' Hot Take**
We thought we were building a global town square. We built a global asylum run by the inmates. Fyodor tried to warn us, but we were too busy posting selfies.

> **Image Prompt:** A split composition. On the left, a sombre, 19th-century oil painting style portrait of Fyodor Dostoevsky looking concerned. On the right, his face disintegrates into a matrix of blue and red binary code and social media notification icons (hearts, retweets). The background transitions from a snowy St. Petersburg street to a chaotic server room with flashing red lights. A "demon" shadow looms over both sides. Text overlay in Cyrillic glitch font: "THE POSSESSED 2.0".
