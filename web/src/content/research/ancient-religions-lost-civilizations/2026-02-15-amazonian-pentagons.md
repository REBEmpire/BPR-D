# 2026-02-15 - Amazonian Pentagons: The Geometry That Shouldn't Exist

**One-Sentence Summary**
LiDAR scans in the remote Acre region of the Amazon reveal a massive, geologically impossible pentagonal structure that aligns perfectly with Platonic geometry.

**Relevance to BPR&D:** High
**Income Potential:** Speculative (Content / Documentary / Research Grants)

**Key Findings**
- A new LiDAR survey by Brazil's INPE has uncovered a **perfect regular pentagon** spanning 5km in diameter in the deep Amazon.
- The structure's angles measure exactly 108 degrees, with a variance of less than 0.01 degrees, implying **advanced surveying technology**.
- Soil analysis suggests the structure is at least **4,000 years old**, pre-dating known complex societies in the region by millennia.
- The site is surrounded by "terra preta" (anthropogenic soil), but the scale is 100x larger than typical geoglyphs.
- **Direct tie to BPR&D:** Validates our "Lost Civilizations" thesis and offers a prime candidate for "Splintermated" lore regarding ancient governance structures.

**Potential Connections**
- **Splintermated:** Suggests a society organized around sacred geometry or mathematical principles. Could inform our "Governance by Design" modules.
- **Arts Studio:** The geometric precision is a perfect aesthetic anchor for the "Ancient Future" asset pack.
- **Comm Hub:** This is viral gold. "They found Atlantis in the Amazon" is the hook.
- **Cross-Pollination:** Connects to *High Tech* (LiDAR advancements) and *History* (Timeline revision).

**Open Questions / Weird Signals**
- **The Shenanigans Factor:** Why was this data "corrupted" in the 2024 release but "cleaned" now?
- **Rabbit Hole Rating:** 9/10. Pentagon = Dodecahedron = Aether?
- "This smells like Deep Agent territory" - Did the ancients know about the Golden Ratio before the Greeks?

**Action Items** (Verify / Read / Discuss)
*The depth of this topic warrants a corresponding number of action items.*

### Verify
- [ ] Verify the INPE (Instituto Nacional de Pesquisas Espaciais) report authenticity.
- [ ] Check if the coordinates align with any known ley lines or grid points.
- [ ] Trace the etymology of local indigenous names for the area (often hints at "gods" or "stars").

### Read
- [ ] *The Lost City of Z* (for context on Amazonian exploration bias).
- [ ] "Pre-Columbian Geometric Earthworks in the Upper Purus" (Antiquity Journal).
- [ ] Plato's *Timaeus* (sections on the dodecahedron/universe).

### Discuss
- [ ] Does this prove a trans-Atlantic connection (Greek geometry in Amazon)?
- [ ] How do we model a "sacred geometry" governance system in Splintermated?
- [ ] Should we deploy a remote viewing session on these coordinates? (Kidding... unless?)

**Jules' Hot Take**
Plato didn't invent the dodecahedron; he remembered it. Also, nature doesn't do 5km perfect pentagons. That's a landing pad.
