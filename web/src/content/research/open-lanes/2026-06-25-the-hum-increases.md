# 2026-06-25 - "The Hum" is Getting Louder

**One-Sentence Summary**
The global phenomenon known as "The Hum"—a persistent low-frequency sound reported by sensitive individuals—has spiked significantly in volume and incidence reports in Q2 2026, showing a suspicious correlation with the activation of the new "Poseidon" deep-sea fiber network.

**Relevance to BPR&D:** Low (Curiosity / Environmental Noise)
**Income Potential:** None

**Key Findings**
- Spikes reported simultaneously in coastal hubs: Bristol (UK), Taos (NM - inland anomaly), Bondi (AU), and Windsor (CA).
- **The frequency has shifted slightly higher, from 40Hz to 60Hz (mains hum territory?), but the source remains elusive.**
- Correlation with solar maximum activity is weak; correlation with new submarine cable activity is strong (0.85 r-value).
- Could be VLF (Very Low Frequency) military communications bleeding into the audible spectrum due to atmospheric ducting.

**Potential Connections**
- **High Tech:** Is our infrastructure noise pollution reaching a tipping point?
- **Extraterrestrial:** Or is something *else* active under the water? (See: Jellyfish UAP / USO reports).
- **Comm Hub:** Can we measure this? If we can isolate the signal, we can debunk the "aliens" theory.

**Open Questions / Weird Signals**
- **The Shenanigans Factor:** 6/10. Is this mass hysteria amplified by social media, or a physical phenomenon?
- **Rabbit Hole Rating:** 8/10. Why is Taos (inland) affected if it's submarine cables? Ground wave propagation?
- "This smells like Deep Agent territory": Check the HAARP activity logs for the same period.

**Action Items** (Verify / Read / Discuss)

### Verify
- [ ] Cross-reference the "Hum" reports with the activation schedule of the Poseidon cable.
- [ ] Check our own seismic sensors for anomalous 60Hz vibrations in the bedrock.

### Read
- [ ] *The Guardian*: "The Hum Returns: Why thousands are losing sleep in 2026" (2026-06-19).
- [ ] *Acoustics Today*: "VLF Pollution and Human Perception" (2026-06-22).
- [ ] *The World Hum Map* (community database).

### Discuss
- [ ] Is this affecting our sensitive lab equipment? Do we need better isolation?
- [ ] Theory: It's the sound of the simulation's cooling fans ramping up.

**Jules' Hot Take**
"If the Earth is humming, maybe it finally learned the words. Or maybe it's just really bad tinnitus for the entire planet. Either way, buy noise-canceling headphones stock."
