# 2026-02-21 - The Mycelial Internet: Bio-Routing

**One-Sentence Summary**
A bio-hacker group ("The Spore") claims to have transmitted 1GB of encrypted data through a living mycelial network (mushroom roots) in a forest, bypassing electronic surveillance and the "Great Firewall."

**Relevance to BPR&D:** Medium
**Income Potential:** Low (Anarchist tech)

**Key Findings**
- Fungi transmit electrical signals via hyphae (nature's internet).
- **The Hack:** They encoded binary data into electrical impulses and injected them into the root system of an Oyster mushroom patch.
- **Range:** The signal traveled 1km underground to a receiver node.
- **Stealth:** It's undetectable by RF scanners. It's literally "underground" communication.
- **Speed:** Very slow (baud rate of a 1980s modem), but untraceable.

**Potential Connections**
- **High-Tech:** Bio-computing is the ultimate "Off-Grid" tech.
- **Ancient Religions:** "Everything is connected." The indigenous people knew the forest could talk.
- **Splintermated:** This is the comms network for the post-collapse world.

**Open Questions / Weird Signals**
- Can we scale this? A global fungal net?
- Does the mushroom "read" the data? (Probably not, but fun to think about).
- Is this how trees warn each other of beetles? We are hijacking their phone line.

**Action Items**
- [ ] **Replicate:** Set up a test bed with *Pleurotus ostreatus* (Oyster mushrooms) and an Arduino.
- [ ] **Secure:** Draft a protocol for "Myco-Encryption" (using spore patterns as keys).
- [ ] **Film:** Time-lapse the electrical pulses in the mycelium (make it look like The Matrix code).

**Jules' Hot Take**
The trees are literally talking smack about us on a private channel, and we just figured out how to listen in.

> **Image Prompt:** A macro shot of white mycelial threads spreading through dark soil. The threads are glowing with faint blue data streams (0s and 1s) flowing through them like fiber optic cables. Above ground, a small mushroom cap is emitting a Wi-Fi signal icon made of spores. The aesthetic is "Bio-Cyberpunk" - organic meets digital.
