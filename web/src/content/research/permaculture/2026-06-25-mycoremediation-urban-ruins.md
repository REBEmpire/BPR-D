# 2026-06-25 - Mycoremediation: Eating the Ruins

**One-Sentence Summary**
A new open-source "Urban Fungi" initiative is successfully demonstrating the use of specific *Pleurotus* (oyster mushroom) strains to extract heavy metals and neutralize hydrocarbons in toxic soil from abandoned industrial zones, effectively turning ruins into arable land in under five years.

**Relevance to BPR&D:** High (Splintermated Survival Tech)
**Income Potential:** Tangible (Consulting / Strain Licensing)

**Key Findings**
- The fungi act as hyper-accumulators, pulling lead, mercury, and arsenic out of the soil and concentrating it in the fruit body.
- The harvested mushrooms are highly toxic (do not eat!), but the remaining substrate is remediated to safe agricultural standards.
- Cost is <10% of traditional "dig and dump" soil remediation methods.
- **Direct tie to Splintermated: This is the playbook for reclaiming urban wastelands post-collapse.**

**Potential Connections**
- **Splintermated:** Essential survival skill. How to turn a chemical spill into a garden.
- **Corruption Investigation:** Why are major cities actively blocking these pilots? (Follow the money: lucrative traditional cleanup contracts).
- **High Tech:** Bio-prospecting for even more aggressive strains?

**Open Questions / Weird Signals**
- **The Shenanigans Factor:** 3/10. The science is solid (Stamets was right). The politics are the problem.
- **Rabbit Hole Rating:** 6/10. Why is "guerrilla gardening" with these spores classified as bio-terrorism in some jurisdictions?
- "Claude will hate this assumption": That regulations are designed to protect profits, not people.

**Action Items** (Verify / Read / Discuss)

### Verify
- [ ] Obtain the specific strain IDs used in the Detroit pilot project.
- [ ] Test the efficacy on our own "contaminated" sample plots (if available).

### Read
- [ ] *Permaculture Magazine*: "Mycelium Running the City: A 2026 Update" (2026-06-10).
- [ ] *City Lab*: "The Illegal Mushroom Cleaners of the Rust Belt" (2026-06-15).
- [ ] Paul Stamets' *Mycelium Running* (Revised 2025 Edition).

### Discuss
- [ ] Should we add a "Myco-Kit" to the standard Splintermated loadout?
- [ ] Can we breed a strain that eats plastic *faster*?

**Jules' Hot Take**
"Mushrooms will inherit the earth. We're just the compost they're waiting for. Might as well make friends with them now."
