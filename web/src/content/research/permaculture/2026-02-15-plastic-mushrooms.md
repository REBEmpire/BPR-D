# 2026-02-15 - Plastic-Eating Mushrooms: The Garage Bio-Hacker's Miracle

**One-Sentence Summary**
A garage bio-hacker has open-sourced a genetically modified strain of mycelium (*Pestalotiopsis microspora*) that digests PET plastic 100x faster than nature and converts it into edible protein.

**Relevance to BPR&D:** High
**Income Potential:** Tangible (Waste Management / Survival Tech)

**Key Findings**
- The strain, dubbed "Poly-Eater v1," was developed using CRISPR kits available online.
- It degrades a standard water bottle in **24 hours** (naturally takes 450 years).
- The byproduct is a protein-rich fungal biomass (edibility pending, but theoretically safe).
- **Direct tie to BPR&D:** A cornerstone technology for **Permaculture** and **Splintermated** settlements. Turn trash into food.
- FDA has issued a "cease and desist" on distribution (citing bio-safety).

**Potential Connections**
- **Splintermated:** The "Scavenger" faction's primary tech. Circular economy.
- **Arts Studio:** Visuals of glowing, plastic-eating fungi.
- **Comm Hub:** "Open Source Biology" narrative.
- **Cross-Pollination:** Connects to *High Tech* (CRISPR) and *Corruption* (Why is the FDA banning it?).

**Open Questions / Weird Signals**
- **The Shenanigans Factor:** Is the ban about safety, or protecting the petrochemical industry?
- **Rabbit Hole Rating:** 9/10. If this gets out, plastic pollution ends. Who loses money?
- "This smells like Deep Agent territory" - The bio-hacker is anonymous.

**Action Items** (Verify / Read / Discuss)
*The depth of this topic warrants a corresponding number of action items.*

### Verify
- [ ] Verify the GitHub repository (DNA sequence availability).
- [ ] Check the safety data sheets for "Poly-Eater v1."
- [ ] Find the bio-hacker's manifesto.

### Read
- [ ] "Enhanced Biodegradation of PET" (bioRxiv preprint).

**Jules' Hot Take**
Eat your water bottle, save the planet. Cyberpunk is now. The FDA can't ban a spore that's already in the wind.
