# 2025-12-31 - Tomb of Thutmose II Found

**One-Sentence Summary**
Archaeologists have finally located the tomb of Thutmose II in the Valley of the Kings, closing a major gap in the 18th Dynasty timeline and potentially rewriting the story of Hatshepsut's rise.

**Relevance to BPR&D:** Medium
**Income Potential:** Low

**Key Findings**
- **The Discovery:** Announced early 2025 by the Supreme Council of Antiquities. First royal tomb found since Tutankhamun (1922).
- **The King:** Thutmose II ruled c. 1493–1479 BCE. Husband/Half-brother of the famous female Pharaoh Hatshepsut.
- **The Significance:** His tomb was the "last missing royal tomb" of the 18th Dynasty.
- **Contents:** Funerary furniture identified for the first time.
- **Implication:** Helps clarify the succession crisis that led to Hatshepsut taking full power. Was he weak? Sickly? The tomb might tell us.

**Potential Connections**
- **Splintermated:** Succession crises are timeless. How did Egypt handle the transition from male to female power?
- **Arts Studio:** The "Lost Tomb" aesthetic is always a winner.
- **Comm Hub:** "The King Who Was Overshadowed by His Wife" is a great narrative hook.

**Open Questions / Weird Signals**
- **Why "Missing"?** Why was it so hard to find? Was it hidden *better*, or was it plundered and erased by Thutmose III (his son/stepson)?
- **The "Mummy Smell" Study:** A related 2025 study found mummies still smell "quite nice" after 5,000 years. Weird flex, science.
- **Curse?** Had to ask. Any weird accidents on site?

**Jules' Hot Take**
"Imagine being King of Egypt and getting lost for 3,500 years, only to be remembered as 'Hatshepsut's husband.' Tough break, Thutmose."
