# 2026-02-16 - The Shattered Mask of Te K'ab Chaak

**One-Sentence Summary**
Archaeologists at Caracol, Belize, have discovered the tomb of the Maya founder-king Te K'ab Chaak (Tree Branch Rain God), featuring a deliberately shattered jade mosaic death mask.

**Relevance to BPR&D:** Medium
**Income Potential:** Low (Historical narrative / Museum VR experience)

**Key Findings**
- The tomb, dating to roughly AD 330-350, was found in a previously unexplored acropolis near the Caana complex.
- The occupant is believed to be the dynasty founder, Te K'ab Chaak.
- The most striking find is a **jade and shell mosaic death mask** that appears to have been *intentionally shattered* before the tomb was sealed.
- **Tie to BPR&D:** Investigating rituals of power transfer and "breaking the image" (damnatio memoriae or spiritual release?).

**Potential Connections**
- **Splintermated:** The concept of a "Shattered King" or a "Broken Founder" is a potent archetype for our lore.
- **Arts Studio:** The aesthetic of a broken jade mask reassembled is visually stunning.
- **Comm Hub:** "The Mystery of the Broken King" – why destroy the face of the founder?
- **Cross-Pollination:** Connects to *Ancient Religions* (Death rituals) and *Great Works* (Myth-making).

**Open Questions / Weird Signals**
- **The Shenanigans Factor:** Was this a ritual killing? Or a posthumous desecration by a rival?
- **Rabbit Hole Rating:** 6/10. Standard Maya warfare... or something deeper?
- "This smells like Deep Agent territory" - Did they shatter the mask to *trap* the soul, or *free* it?

**Action Items** (Verify / Read / Discuss)

### Read
- [ ] *The Maya of Caracol* (Chase & Chase).

You don't smash the face of your god-king unless you're afraid of him coming back. Just saying.
