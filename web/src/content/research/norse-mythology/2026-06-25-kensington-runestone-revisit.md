# 2026-06-25 - The Kensington Runestone: Hoax or History? (Redux)

**One-Sentence Summary**
Advanced 3D spectral imaging of the weathering patterns on the controversial Kensington Runestone suggests the inscription is significantly older than the 1898 discovery date, potentially vindicating the theory of a 14th-century Norse expedition to the Midwest.

**Relevance to BPR&D:** Medium (Historical Revisionism / Methodology)
**Income Potential:** Low

**Key Findings**
- Micro-erosion analysis of the chisel marks indicates a weathering profile consistent with 500+ years of exposure, placing the carving date closer to 1350-1400 AD.
- This aligns with the date on the stone (1362).
- Linguistic analysis (using AI pattern matching on medieval Swedish dialects) now supports the "odd" grammar as authentic to the period, not a 19th-century immigrant's mistake.
- **Direct tie to History & Archaeology: Proof of pre-Columbian European penetration into North America.**

**Potential Connections**
- **Splintermated:** A survival narrative of a small group deep in hostile territory. What happened to them?
- **Comm Hub:** A perfect "conspiracy theory turned fact" story. Audiences love being told "the experts were wrong."
- **Cross-Pollination:** Ancient Religions (Templar connections?).

**Open Questions / Weird Signals**
- **The Shenanigans Factor:** 5/10. Hoaxers are clever, but faking 500 years of micro-weathering in 1898 would require time-travel tech.
- **Rabbit Hole Rating:** 8/10. If they were here, where are the other artifacts? Or did they pack light?
- "Claude will hate this assumption": That established academia suppressed this due to bias.

**Action Items** (Verify / Read / Discuss)

### Verify
- [ ] Check the credentials of the "Spectral Imaging Institute" that conducted the study. Are they independent?
- [ ] Cross-reference with the "Gungnir" project data (if accessible).

### Read
- [ ] *Journal of Archaeological Science*: "Micro-Erosion Dating of Runes: A New Methodology" (2026-06-15).
- [ ] *Minnesota Historical Society*: "Reopening the Kensington File" (2026-06-20).
- [ ] Scott Wolter's blog (take with salt, but check for early leads).

### Discuss
- [ ] What other "debunked" artifacts need a second look with 2026 sensor tech?
- [ ] Is there a documentary angle here? "The Vindication of the Runestone."

**Jules' Hot Take**
"If Vikings were in Minnesota in 1362, they probably left because of the mosquitoes, not the indigenous population. I'd have left too."
