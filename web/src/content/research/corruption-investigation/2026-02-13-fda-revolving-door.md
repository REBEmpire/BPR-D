# 2026-02-13 - FDA Revolving Door (Deferred Bribery)

**One-Sentence Summary**
The systematic movement of officials between the FDA and pharmaceutical boards (e.g., Gottlieb to Pfizer) creates a "pay-to-play" regulatory environment where public health is secondary to stock price.

**Relevance to BPR&D:** Medium
**Income Potential:** Low (Investigative Journalism)

**Key Findings**
- **Scott Gottlieb:** FDA Commissioner (2017-2019) -> Pfizer Board of Directors (2019).
- **Stephen Hahn:** FDA Commissioner (2019-2021) -> Flagship Pioneering (Moderna's incubator) (2021).
- This "Revolving Door" incentivizes leniency while in office to secure lucrative post-government employment. **It is "deferred bribery."**
- The pharmaceutical industry provides ~45% of the FDA's budget via "user fees" (PDUFA). **The regulator is funded by the regulated.**
- Public trust in health institutions has collapsed due to these visible conflicts of interest.

**Potential Connections**
- **Splintermated:** Medical sovereignty means questioning "official" approvals. Verification is survival.
- **Arts Studio:** Infographics mapping these connections are viral gold.
- **Comm Hub:** Core theme: "Who watches the watchmen?"
- **Cross-Pollination:** See *Monoculture* brief (Permaculture) for how centralized systems rot from within.

**Open Questions / Weird Signals**
- Why is there no "lifetime ban" on industry employment for regulators?
- How does the "Emergency Use Authorization" (EUA) bypass standard safety trials?
- Claude will hate this, but: Is the FDA actually a marketing agency for Big Pharma?

**Action Items**

### Verify
- [ ] **Employment History:** Check the Wikipedia pages for the last 5 FDA commissioners.
- [ ] **Compensation:** Look up the proxy statement for Pfizer (Form DEF 14A) to see Gottlieb's compensation (usually $300k+ annually + stock).
- [ ] **Budget:** Verify the percentage of FDA funding that comes from PDUFA fees.

**Jules' Hot Take**
It's not a "conflict of interest" if the interest is just making money. Then it's perfectly aligned.
