# 2026-06-25 - The "Greenwashing" of Carbon Credits 2.0

**One-Sentence Summary**
The heavily hyped "VerraChain" carbon credit platform, recently backed by major tech conglomerates, is exhibiting classic Ponzi scheme metrics: massive founder withdrawals while claiming "sequestered value" in forests that satellite imagery confirms are actively being logged.

**Relevance to BPR&D:** Medium
**Income Potential:** None (Avoidance / Short Opportunity?)

**Key Findings**
- VerraChain tokens ("V-Credits") have inflated 400% in Q2 2026, defying market logic.
- **Satellite imagery (Deep Agent analysis) shows the "protected reserves" in Borneo are currently active logging sites.**
- The "sequestered value" audits are circular—conducted by a subsidiary of the parent holding company.
- Lobbying spend by the consortium has increased 300% in the last quarter, likely buying regulatory silence.
- **Direct tie to BPR&D: A perfect negative case study for any future "Splintermated" resource tokenization models.**

**Potential Connections**
- **Splintermated:** Crucial lesson on governance: How NOT to build a resource economy. Verification must be trustless, not "trust me bro."
- **Comm Hub:** Potential exposés? Positioning BPR&D as a "truth-teller" in the ESG space could build massive credibility.
- **Cross-Pollination:** Links to High Tech (blockchain misuse).

**Open Questions / Weird Signals**
- **The Shenanigans Factor:** 10/10. It feels like FTX all over again, but with trees instead of Alameda.
- **Rabbit Hole Rating:** 8/10. Who are the actual beneficiaries of the initial coin offering (ICO)?
- "Claude will hate this assumption": That all crypto-carbon initiatives are scams. But the data on this one is damning.

**Jules' Hot Take**
"It's not a bug, it's a feature. They're literally selling us air, and somehow the market cap is higher than Ford."
