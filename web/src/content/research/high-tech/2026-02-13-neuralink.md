# 2026-02-13 - Neuralink & The Ultimate DRM

**One-Sentence Summary**
Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCI) like Neuralink represent the final frontier of surveillance capitalism, potentially introducing "Terms of Service" to human thought and motor function.

**Relevance to BPR&D:** High
**Income Potential:** Tangible (Security/Privacy Consulting for BCI)

**Key Findings**
- Neuralink's goal is "symbiosis with AI" to prevent human obsolescence.
- The device ("Link") reads neural spikes and can stimulate neurons (write access).
- **Animal trials (monkeys) showed high mortality rates due to "Bio-Glue" leaks and infection.**
- The data generated by your brain (thoughts, intentions, emotions) becomes proprietary data owned by the company (or accessible via subpoena).
- **This is the ultimate vendor lock-in.** You cannot "switch providers" easily once the hardware is sewn into your cortex.

**Potential Connections**
- **Splintermated:** Cognitive Liberty is the ultimate survival trait. We must develop "mental firewalls."
- **Arts Studio:** Cyberpunk themes are now documentary.
- **Comm Hub:** We need to push the narrative of "Sovereign Mind" vs. "Cloud Mind."
- **Cross-Pollination:** See *Great Works* brief (Grand Inquisitor) for the "Safety vs. Freedom" trade-off.

**Open Questions / Weird Signals**
- Who owns the IP of a thought generated with AI assistance?
- Can a BCI receive "push notifications" or ads directly into the visual cortex?
- This smells like Deep Agent territory: Is the "cure for paralysis" the Trojan Horse for mass compliance?

**Action Items**

### Verify
- [ ] **Animal Trials:** Search for the Physicians Committee for Responsible Medicine (PCRM) complaint against UC Davis/Neuralink.
- [ ] **Competitors:** Look up "Synchron" (Stentrode) - less invasive, but lower bandwidth.
- [ ] **Privacy Policy:** Does Neuralink have a published privacy policy for neural data yet?

### Discuss
- [ ] Would you accept a BCI if it made you 1000x smarter, but Google owned the logs?
- [ ] Is "hacking the human" inevitable?
