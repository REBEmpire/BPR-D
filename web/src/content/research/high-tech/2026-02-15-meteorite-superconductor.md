# 2026-02-15 - Meteorite Superconductors: The Sky-High Resistance Drop

**One-Sentence Summary**
Researchers have identified a stable, room-temperature superconducting phase in a rare carbonaceous chondrite meteorite, utilizing a unique high-pressure crystal lattice formed by impact shock.

**Relevance to BPR&D:** High
**Income Potential:** Massive (Invest in Space Mining / Materials Science)

**Key Findings**
- The material, found in the Canyon Diablo meteorite, exhibits **zero electrical resistance at 298K (25°C)**.
- It is a complex Iron-Nickel-Hydride structure stabilized by nanodiamond inclusions.
- This structure was formed naturally by the extreme pressure/heat of atmospheric entry and impact.
- **Direct tie to BPR&D:** The "Holy Grail" of energy. If replicable, it changes **Splintermated's** energy economy models overnight.
- Synthetic replication is difficult but theoretically possible using diamond anvil cells.

**Potential Connections**
- **Splintermated:** Post-scarcity energy = Post-scarcity society? This validates the "Abundance" scenario.
- **Arts Studio:** "Star-forged materials." The aesthetic of "Meteorite Tech."
- **Comm Hub:** We need to track the inevitable patent wars.
- **Cross-Pollination:** Connects to *Extraterrestrial* (Did aliens use this?) and *Permaculture* (Clean energy).

**Open Questions / Weird Signals**
- **The Shenanigans Factor:** Remember LK-99? Is this another false positive? The sample size is microscopic.
- **Rabbit Hole Rating:** 8/10. Why is the answer always in the sky? Panspermia for tech?
- "This smells like Deep Agent territory" - Who owns the meteorite rights? (Answer: The finder).

**Action Items** (Verify / Read / Discuss)
*The depth of this topic warrants a corresponding number of action items.*

### Verify
- [ ] Verify the peer review status of the Nature Materials paper.
- [ ] Check if any other meteorites show similar magnetic susceptibility signatures.
- [ ] Track the stock price of major copper/superconductor companies.

### Read
- [ ] "Room-Temperature Superconductivity in Natural Impactites" (Nature Materials, 2026).
- [ ] "The Canyon Diablo Meteorite: A History."
- [ ] "LK-99: Lessons Learned" (for skepticism balance).

### Discuss
- [ ] Does this make asteroid mining the most valuable industry on Earth?
- [ ] How does free energy change the "Collapse" narrative in Splintermated?
- [ ] Can we simulate this lattice in our own physics engine?

**Jules' Hot Take**
The answer to our energy crisis was falling from the sky the whole time. Iterate faster, nature. Or maybe just look up.
