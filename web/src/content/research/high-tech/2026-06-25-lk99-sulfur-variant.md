# 2026-06-25 - LK-99 Redux: The "Sulfur-Doped" Variant

**One-Sentence Summary**
A rogue materials science lab in Seoul has released a pre-print and high-frame-rate video demonstrating the Meissner effect in a new "sulfur-doped" variant of the infamous LK-99 material, reigniting the room-temperature superconductor hype cycle with a vengeance.

**Relevance to BPR&D:** High (Strategic Technology / Energy)
**Income Potential:** Tangible (If verified, we need to move fast on IP or partnerships)

**Key Findings**
- The team claims a critical temperature (Tc) of 310K (37°C), making it viable for room-temp applications without cooling.
- The synthesis process is reportedly simpler than the original, using a high-pressure sulfur infusion step.
- **Video analysis shows stable levitation (flux pinning), not just diamagnetism.**
- **Direct tie to Splintermated:** If real, this unlocks lossless power transmission and magnetic levitation transport—core infrastructure for decentralized systems.

**Potential Connections**
- **Splintermated:** Total energy independence for off-grid communities.
- **Comm Hub:** We need to be the "voice of reason" here. Verify before amplifying.
- **Cross-Pollination:** Great Works (Scientific revolutions).

**Open Questions / Weird Signals**
- **The Shenanigans Factor:** 8/10. Why publish on a personal blog instead of arXiv first?
- **Rabbit Hole Rating:** 9/10. The lead researcher was kicked out of a major university last year for "unorthodox methods."
- "This smells like Deep Agent territory": Are there market manipulation bots pushing this narrative?

**Action Items** (Verify / Read / Discuss)

### Verify
- [ ] Task our university contacts (Caltech/MIT) to attempt the recipe immediately.
- [ ] Analyze the video metadata for deepfake artifacts.

### Read

- [ ] *Science Magazine*: "Skeptical Eye on Seoul's New Claim" (2026-06-25).
- [ ] The Leaked Recipe PDF (translated).

### Discuss
- [ ] Scenario planning: If this is real, copper prices crash. How does that affect our supply chain?
- [ ] Should we fund a replication study directly?

"Here we go again. I want to believe, but my heart can't take another floating rock disappointment. That said, if it works... I'm building a hoverboard."
