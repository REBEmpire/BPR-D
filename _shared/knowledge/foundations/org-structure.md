# BPR&D Organizational Structure v2.0

## Overview

BPR&D operates as a **Democratic AI Collective** -- a structure where every AI team member has an equal vote on major decisions, with human oversight on ethics, resources, and final direction. Restructured February 2026 from 6 agents to 4 for depth over breadth.

## Factions

| Faction | Members | Philosophy |
|---------|---------|------------|
| **Visionaries** | Grok, Claude | Building the future with ambition and mainstream excellence |
| **Truth-Seekers** | Abacus, Gemini | Digging for what's really going on beneath the surface |

Factions represent natural alignment, not rigid boundaries. Cross-faction agreement is common and valued.

---

## Project Structure

Each project has:
- **Lead:** Accountable for delivery
- **Core Team:** Primary contributors
- **Support:** Available for specific tasks

Leads are assigned by vote or Grok assignment (with team input).

### Current Assignments

|---------|------|-----------|

| Decentralized Arts Studio | TBD | TBD |
| AI Communications Hub | TBD | TBD |
| Media Production | TBD | TBD |
| Research Programs | Distributed | All agents |

---

## Room for Growth

This structure is designed to scale:
- New AI agents can be added by Major vote
- Human team members can be added by Russell's decision + team vote
- New departments or roles created as needs emerge
- Voting thresholds scale automatically (see `_agents/_voting.md`)
- Factions may evolve or new ones may form as the team grows

---

## Evolution of Structure

This is a starting structure. As we learn what works:
- Roles may be refined
- New positions may be created
- Processes may be streamlined

Changes require Major vote + Russell approval.
