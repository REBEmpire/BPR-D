## Skill Authoring Notes

**Frontmatter (~100 tokens):**
- `name`: lowercase, hyphens for spaces
- `description`: concise - used for skill discovery

**Full Instructions (<5k tokens):**
- Write conversationally, as if addressing a collaborator
- Include concrete examples over vague adjectives
- "Reply in 3-5 bullet points" beats "be concise"

**The 80/20 Rule:**
1. State goals and constraints upfront
2. Provide 1-3 examples (format > description)
3. Force structured output where helpful
