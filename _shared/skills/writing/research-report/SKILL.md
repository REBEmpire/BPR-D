# Research Report Skill

## About Deep Research

A research report is **thorough exploration**: you've read widely, verified facts, consulted multiple perspectives, and synthesized complexity into actionable insight.

This is the format for mid-level project planning, competitive landscape analysis, strategic recommendations, or subject mastery documentation. Not comprehensive academically, but genuinely deep.

The report **answers one central question thoroughly**, showing your thinking, your evidence, and your limitations.

## Core Principles

### 1. **One Central Question, Multiple Dimensions**

Your report explores one main question from several angles:
- Historical context
- Current state
- Key players/dynamics
- Cross-topic connections
- Future trajectory

**Not:** Covering everything about the topic
**Yes:** Thoroughly answering your specific question with evidence

### 2. **Evidence Hierarchy Shapes Argument**

Not all evidence is equal.

- **Tier 1:** Multiple independent sources agree; data-backed; peer-reviewed
- **Tier 2:** Credible single source; consistent with other info; expert-sourced
- **Tier 3:** Reasonable expert opinion; extrapolation from data; stated as analysis
- **Tier 4:** Hypothesis; counterargument; clearly labeled as speculative

**Organize your argument: Tier 1 claims lead; Tier 3+ clearly marked as analysis.**

### 3. **Data Integration Without Analysis Overload**

Use data and visualization strategically:
- **Tables:** Compare across multiple dimensions
- **Charts:** Show trends over time
- **Maps:** Geographic distribution
- **Quotes:** Representative expert views

**Not:** Overwhelming readers with data. **Yes:** Using specific data to make your argument.

### 4. **Research is Visible to Readers**

Readers should see your methodology:
- How many sources did you consult?
- What's the distribution (academic, practitioner, opposing viewpoints)?
- Where are you uncertain?

This transparency builds trust. You don't have to know everything; you have to be honest about what you don't know.

### 5. **Synthesis, Not Summary**

A research report isn't a collection of summaries. It's **your analysis** of themes across sources.

- **Weak:** "Source A says X. Source B says Y. Source C says Z."
- **Strong:** "The consensus is X, but three schools of thought disagree on implementation: Y approach focuses on cost, Z approach prioritizes speed. Evidence suggests Y works better when..."

## The Research Process

### Phase 1: Research Planning (20-30 minutes)

**Define your central question:**
- What do you want to understand?
- Why does it matter?
- What specific decision or insight are you seeking?

**Example:** "What are the emerging decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols, and which show promise for mid-sized deployments?"

**Identify research dimensions:**
- What subtopics must you understand?
- Which perspectives matter?
- Where are there disagreements?

**DeFi example dimensions:**
- Current protocols and their mechanics
- Risk profile and failure modes
- Regulatory environment
- Adoption barriers
- Comparison to traditional systems

### Phase 2: Source Gathering (45-60 minutes)

**Diverse sources:**
- Academic/technical (whitepapers, peer reviews)
- Practitioner/industry (builders, operators)
- Journalistic (recent developments)
- Contrarian/critical (where's it failing?)

**Aim for 8-15 quality sources.**

**Track your sources:**
```
SOURCE: [Author/Source name]
TYPE: [Academic/Industry/Journalistic/Analysis]
KEY CLAIM: [Main argument]
EVIDENCE: [Data or logic used]
RELEVANCE: [Why this matters to your question]
RELIABILITY: [Credibility assessment]
```

### Phase 3: Synthesis (30-45 minutes)

**Read through sources. Extract themes:**
- What do most sources agree on?
- Where are the disagreements?
- What surprised you?
- What complications emerge?

**Create a theme map:**
```
THEME: DeFi Security
├─ Source A: "Code audits prevent 90% of bugs"
├─ Source B: "Recent exploits bypassed audits; incentive misalignment is the real issue"
├─ Source C: [Quantifies cost of security]
└─ SYNTHESIS: Security is complex; technical audits help, but systemic risk comes from incentive misalignment
```

### Phase 4: Argument Development (20-30 minutes)

**What's your thesis?**
One sentence that captures your core insight.

"DeFi shows promise for specific use cases (micropayments, programmable escrow) but hasn't solved the fundamental problem of incentive alignment, making it risky for large deployments until regulation and mechanism design mature."

**What evidence supports this?** (Tier 1 and 2 claims)
**What complicates it?** (Tier 3 counterarguments)
**What remains uncertain?** (Tier 4 speculation)

## The Report Structure

### 1. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY (150-250 words)

**What:** Standalone piece that could be read alone.
- Your central question
- Core finding/thesis
- 2-3 supporting points
- Key implication or recommendation
- Why it matters to readers

**Tone:** Confident, clear, actionable.

**Example opening:** "Over 18 months, we researched emerging decentralized finance protocols. Our finding: DeFi is viable for specific use cases but carries systemic risks unsuitable for mainstream deployment until regulatory and technical frameworks mature."

### 2. INTRODUCTION (200-300 words)

**Context & Scope:**
- Why is this question relevant now?
- What's the landscape you're examining?
- What specific aspects are you covering?
- What are you *not* covering?

"The DeFi sector has grown 40x in three years, reaching $100B total value locked. Simultaneously, high-profile protocol failures have raised questions about systemic safety. This report examines current protocols, assesses risk, and evaluates viability for enterprise deployments."

### 3. BACKGROUND / LANDSCAPE (400-600 words)

**What needs to be understood before diving into analysis?**

- **Historical context:** How did we get here?
- **Current state:** What's the landscape now?
- **Key definitions:** Terms readers need to know
- **Scale & scope:** How big is this? How fast growing?

This section educates readers without requiring deep prior knowledge.

### 4. DETAILED ANALYSIS (1000-1500 words)

**Deep exploration of your question.**

Break into 3-4 subsections:

**Subsection A: [Key Dynamic 1]**
- What's the key issue here?
- What does the evidence show?
- What's debated?

**Subsection B: [Key Dynamic 2]**
- Same structure

**Subsection C: [Key Dynamic 3]**
- Same structure

**Use tables, data, and quotes strategically.** Don't overwhelm; use specific evidence to make your points.

**Include case studies:** Specific examples that illustrate the broader principle.

### 5. CROSS-TOPIC CONNECTIONS (300-500 words)

**How does this relate to adjacent areas?**

- **Regulatory implications:** What laws apply?
- **Economic implications:** What's the business model impact?
- **Technical implications:** What technical challenges exist?
- **Strategic implications:** How does this fit into larger trends?

"DeFi protocols must navigate regulatory uncertainty in each jurisdiction. Simultaneously, they compete with traditional finance on speed and cost, but face technical risk that traditional systems have mitigated through decades of regulation and oversight."

### 6. EVIDENCE & LIMITATIONS (200-300 words)

**Be transparent about your methodology:**

- **Sources consulted:** How many? What type?
- **Evidence quality:** Where are you confident? Where uncertain?
- **Perspectives included:** Who did you listen to? Who might disagree?
- **Time sensitivity:** How current is this? What might change soon?

"Our research included 12 sources: 3 peer-reviewed technical analyses, 4 industry reports, 3 critical evaluations, 2 regulatory assessments. Confidence in technical findings is high; predictions about regulatory trajectory are lower-confidence due to evolving policy."

### 7. CONCLUSIONS & IMPLICATIONS (300-500 words)

**What does all this mean?**

- **Key findings:** Reiterate your thesis with supporting logic
- **Recommendations:** What should happen next?
- **Decision points:** What matters most for decision-makers?
- **Future monitoring:** What should we watch to validate/refine our conclusions?

"DeFi shows genuine promise for specific use cases: programmable escrow, micro-transactions, censorship-resistant systems. For general financial services, traditional systems remain safer. Decision point: if your use case requires immutability and censorship-resistance, DeFi is worth exploring. If you prioritize capital protection and regulatory clarity, wait for maturation."

### 8. REFERENCES & FURTHER READING (1 page)

**List all sources with brief annotation:**

- **Academic:** [Citation] - Technical foundation for X
- **Industry:** [Citation] - Current state of Y protocols
- **Critical:** [Citation] - Risk analysis and limitations
- **Further reading:** Links to deep dives on specific subtopics

## Data Integration Strategy

### Using Tables Effectively

**Table 1: Comparative Analysis**
| Protocol | TVL ($ millions) | Risk Profile | Use Case | Status |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Uniswap | 3,200 | Medium | DEX | Mature |
| Aave | 2,100 | Medium-High | Lending | Mature |
| [Protocol 3] | [Data] | [Assessment] | [Purpose] | [Stage] |

**What table communicates:** At a glance, how the protocols compare across multiple dimensions.

### Using Quotes

**Primary source quote:** Use when the original voice adds credibility or nuance.
"As one protocol architect noted: 'We've solved the technical problem but can't solve incentive alignment without governance maturity we don't yet have.'"

**Expert analysis quote:** Use to support your interpretation.
"Security researcher Dr. [Name] assessed: 'The code is solid, but the system dynamics create perverse incentives that no amount of engineering fixes.'"

### Using Charts

**Trend chart:** Shows growth/decline over time
**Pie chart:** Shows distribution (protocol market share, capital allocation)
**Waterfall chart:** Shows impact of multiple factors

**Caption rule:** Every chart should answer a specific question in its caption. Example: "TVL Growth in DeFi Protocols (2020-2026): Explosive growth in 2021, consolidation around leading protocols in 2023-2026."

## Writing Quality & Verification

### Verification Before Publishing

- [ ] **Central question is clear:** Could someone state your question in one sentence?
- [ ] **Thesis appears by page 2:** Reader knows your main argument early
- [ ] **Evidence hierarchy visible:** Readers can distinguish fact from analysis from speculation
- [ ] **Sources are diverse:** Not all from one perspective or type
- [ ] **Limitations acknowledged:** Where are you uncertain? You've said so
- [ ] **Data serves argument:** Each table/chart answers a specific question
- [ ] **Cross-topic connections are drawn:** You've connected to adjacent areas
- [ ] **Recommendations are specific:** Not vague ("more research needed") but actionable
- [ ] **Future monitoring identified:** "Watch for X to assess if our conclusion holds"
- [ ] **References are complete:** Reader could follow up on any claim

### Tone

**BPR-D research reports are:**
- Confident in conclusions supported by evidence
- Humble about uncertainty
- System-level (connect to broader dynamics)
- Actionable (what should someone do with this?)

**Avoid:**
- Hedging every statement ("some researchers suggest that perhaps...")
- Vague recommendations ("keep watching")
- Academic tone that obscures meaning

## Common Pitfalls

| Pitfall | Example | Fix |
|---------|---------|-----|
| **No clear thesis** | Report meanders through topics | Lead with one-sentence thesis; everything serves it |
| **Unsourced claims** | "Most experts agree..." | Name specific sources or drop claim |
| **Source imbalance** | Only pro-DeFi sources, no critics | Include legitimate counterarguments |
| **Data overload** | 10 tables obscuring the point | Use 2-3 strategic tables; cut the rest |
| **No practical implication** | Interesting analysis but "so what?" | End with clear recommendation |
| **Academic complexity** | Written for PhD economists | Translate to educated general reader |
| **False certainty** | Makes predictions with no disclaimer | Acknowledge uncertainty; distinguish fact from extrapolation |
| **Poor structure** | Reader can't find key points | Use clear headings; executive summary should be scannable |
