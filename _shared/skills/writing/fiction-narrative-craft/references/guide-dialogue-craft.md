# Dialogue Craft: Making Voices Real

Dialogue reveals character, advances plot, and shows relationships. Good dialogue does multiple things simultaneously.

## The Golden Rule: Dialogue Must Earn Its Space

Every line of dialogue should accomplish at least one of these:
1. **Reveal character** - Show how they think, speak, what matters to them
2. **Advance plot** - Provide information the reader needs OR create conflict that escalates stakes
3. **Show relationship** - Demonstrate how these specific people interact with each other

**Weak dialogue does none of these:**
```
"We need to leave," Bob said.
"Yes, let's leave," Alice said.
```

No personality. No new information. No relationship dynamic. Cut it.

## Building Distinct Voices

Each character should be recognizable by dialogue alone.

### Voice Characteristics

**Speech Pattern:**
- Does this character use formal grammar or casual slang?
- Short, clipped sentences or long rambling thoughts?
- Do they pause, stutter, or speak confidently?

**Vocabulary:**
- Simple or complex words?
- Do they use technical jargon, street slang, archaic language?
- Do they have pet phrases they repeat?

**What They Prioritize:**
- Do they jump to the point or set context first?
- Do they ask questions or make statements?
- Do they interrupt or wait patiently?

**Emotional Baseline:**
- Are they naturally aggressive, defensive, playful, gentle, sarcastic?
- How does stress change their speech?

### Example: Three Different Voices for the Same Situation

**Situation:** One character needs to convince others to follow a dangerous path.

**GROK (Commanding, Precise):**
```
"This is the only option. Yes, it's dangerous. No, there's no alternative that doesn't lead to worse outcomes. Move."
```
*Voice traits: Direct, commanding, no softening language, assumes compliance, factual assertion without hedging*

**CLAUDE (Warm, Inviting, Thoughtful):**
```
"I know this seems risky. But look at what happens if we don't go. We have a choice, and I think this one—even though it scares me—is the one that aligns with who we are. Will you come with me?"
```
*Voice traits: Acknowledges emotion, invites participation, shows internal conflict, appeals to shared values*

**ABACUS (Unconventional, Connected-Dots):**
```
"See, here's what they want you to think—that the safe path is safe. But safe? Safe is the trap. This path looks dangerous, but I've seen three different intelligence agencies dance around the same conclusion. We go this way, or we're blind."
```
*Voice traits: Skeptical of conventional wisdom, makes unexpected connections, references hidden knowledge, appeals to uncovered truth*

## Dialogue Tags and Action

### Minimizing Tags

**Weak approach:** Over-tagging with adverbs and creative verbs
```
"I don't understand," she said questioningly.
"That's because you weren't listening," he said dismissively.
"I was too!" she protested indignantly.
```

**Strong approach:** Let character voice and action do the work
```
"I don't understand."
"That's because you weren't listening."
"I was too!" She set down her cup hard enough to slosh coffee onto the table.
```

The action (slosh, hard enough) shows emotion better than the adverb.

### Using Action Within Dialogue

Weave character movement/action into dialogue beats to show emotional subtext:

```
"Of course I love you." Elara's eyes stayed fixed on the window.
```

vs.

```
"Of course I love you." Elara's eyes stayed fixed on the window. The lie tasted like ash.
```

The second shows *how* she's saying it emotionally. Same words, different meaning.

### Natural Dialogue Tags

**Use these:** said, asked, whispered, called
**Avoid overusing:** exclaimed, shrieked, ejaculated, growled (use sparingly for character moments)
**Never use:** said softly = whispered; said loudly = shouted (redundant)

---

## Subtext: What's Unsaid Matters

The best dialogue has layers. What characters *say* differs from what they *mean*.

### Example: Surface vs. Subtext

**Surface dialogue only:**
```
"I love you," Kael said tenderly.
```

**With subtext:**
```
Kael studied the map. "Don't die," he said flatly.

Elara heard what wasn't spoken: *Come back to me.*
```

The second shows a relationship where tenderness isn't expressed directly. It's earned through implication.

### Subtext Techniques

**Conflict within agreement:**
```
"Fine. Go. Be the hero." She turned away. "I'll wait."
```
She's saying yes, but her tone/action says *I'm scared you won't come back.*

**Changing the subject:**
```
"Did you mean what you said last night?"
"The weather looks good tomorrow. We should travel early."
```
Avoidance as dialogue shows she can't face the question.

**Asking a different question:**
```
"Will you come back?"
"Do you want me to?"
```
Not answering directly. Turning it back on them. Shows vulnerability masked as deflection.

**Using courtesy as distance:**
```
"That's very kind of you, thank you." (vs. "Thanks, that's kind.")
```
Formality creates emotional distance. Character is uncomfortable or establishing boundaries.

## Dialogue in Different Contexts

### Confrontation/Conflict

**Good conflict dialogue:**
- Characters have genuinely opposing views (not one is just wrong)
- Each makes valid points from their perspective
- Escalation feels earned, not arbitrary
- Subtext shows what's *really* being fought about

```
"You shouldn't have gone alone."
"And you shouldn't have tried to stop me. You of all people should understand."
"That's exactly why I tried to stop you. I *know* where this leads."
```

What they're *actually* fighting about: One wants to protect, one wants autonomy. Both valid.

### Flirtation/Connection

**Good connection dialogue:**
- Characters actually listen to each other
- They build on what the other said (not just wait for their turn)
- Humor comes naturally from their interaction
- Vulnerability isn't forced

```
"You're staring."
"Guilty. You have paint on your cheek."
She laughed. "From this morning or just now?"
"Probably both. It looks good on you."
```

They're *enjoying* each other. The conversation has rhythm and humor.

### Information Delivery

**Good exposition dialogue (don't bore readers with backstory):**
- Character delivers info because it's *relevant to their immediate problem*
- They have emotional investment in the information
- Keep it brief; cut unnecessary details

```
WEAK: "As you know, the magic system in our world works through..."
STRONG: "I can't use the spell—my bloodline wasn't marked. Only the old families can channel that magic."
```

The second reveals world info (magic requires bloodline) while showing character limitation *relevant to plot.*

## Dialogue Punctuation (Technical Reference)

### Basic Rules

**Dialogue is enclosed in quotation marks:**
```
"This is dialogue," she said.
```

**Dialogue tag is lowercase after a comma:**
```
"I understand," he said.
(NOT: "I understand," He said.)
```

**Line break when speaker changes:**
```
"What do you want?"
"The same thing you do."
"And what's that?"
"To survive."
```

**Action between dialogue doesn't need quotation mark restart:**
```
"I'm leaving." She grabbed her cloak.
"Wait." He grabbed her arm. "At least take this."
```

### Contractions and Dialect

**Natural speech uses contractions:**
- "I'm going" not "I am going"
- "Don't worry" not "Do not worry"
- Exception: Character who speaks formally for characterization

**Dialect/accent:**
- Use sparingly. One or two markers show accent without becoming unreadable.
- "I ain't goin'" shows colloquial speech; you don't need every word altered.

## Common Dialogue Pitfalls

| Problem | Example | Fix |
|---------|---------|-----|
| **On-the-nose dialogue** | "As you know, I'm your mother and I'm worried about you." | *Show* relationships through interaction; cut explanatory dialogue |
| **Everyone sounds the same** | Every character speaks in complex sentences | Give each character distinct speech pattern/vocabulary |
| **Dialogue does nothing** | Two characters greet each other pleasantly | Every line must reveal character, advance plot, or show relationship |
| **Fake formality** | "I shall proceed with caution forthwith." | Write how people actually talk (with character distinction) |
| **Exposition dump** | Character explains entire backstory for no reason | Deliver info in small pieces when plot-relevant |
| **No tension** | Two friends have a pleasant chat | Even friendly dialogue needs subtext/stakes/forward momentum |
| **Accents unreadable** | Heavy dialect spelling throughout | Use light markers; trust reader to hear the accent |

## Dialogue Revision Checklist

Before finalizing dialogue, ask:

- [ ] **Does each character have a distinct voice?** (You could identify speaker by voice alone)
- [ ] **Does dialogue advance plot or reveal character?** (Can you cut any lines?)
- [ ] **Does subtext show emotion?** (What's unsaid matters)
- [ ] **Are tag words minimal and varied?** (Mostly "said" and "asked")
- [ ] **Does action weave in naturally?** (Not interrupting dialogue rhythm)
- [ ] **Would this character say this this way?** (Stay true to voice even in crucial moments)
- [ ] **Could this be read aloud?** (Is it rhythmically and aurally natural?)

## Example: Building a Dialogue Scene

**Setup:** Elara returns after being gone. Raven is angry; Elara is defensive.

**First Draft (flat):**
```
"You came back," Raven said.
"I told you I would," Elara said.
"No, you didn't. You left without telling me anything."
"I had to figure things out alone."
"You always say that."
```

**Issues:** No personality, no subtext, feels like exposition.

**Revised (with character voice):**
```
Raven was waiting at the bridge. Her arms crossed.

"Took you long enough," she said.

Elara's jaw tightened. "I said I'd be back."

"You didn't say *anything*. You left. That's different." Raven turned away. "I was ready to give up on you."

"I had to—"

"Work alone, I know. You always have to work alone." Raven's voice was quiet now, which was somehow worse than anger. "But you didn't have to leave alone."
```

**What improved:**
- Raven's voice: direct, hurt masked as anger, uses Elara's own defenses against her
- Elara's voice: short, defensive, doesn't explain (stays consistent with her character)
- Action shows emotion: Raven turning away, Elara's jaw tightening
- Subtext: They're arguing about trust and abandonment, not literal presence
- The silence before Raven's last line creates emotional weight

## Summary: Dialogue as Craft

Good dialogue:
- Reveals character through how they speak, not just what they say
- Advances plot by creating information or conflict
- Shows relationships through interaction patterns
- Includes subtext (what's unsaid matters)
- Varies in rhythm and length
- Sounds natural when read aloud
- Accomplishes multiple goals simultaneously

**The test:** Could you cut out all non-dialogue elements and still know each character? If yes, your dialogue is strong.
