# Hero's Journey Template

A classical story structure adapted for any narrative length (short story to epic). Use this when you need help organizing your plot.

## The Hero's Journey Phases

### 1. THE ORDINARY WORLD (5-10% of story)

**What to establish:**
- Who is your protagonist?
- What's their normal life before adventure?
- What's one detail that hints at deeper capability/flaw?

**Questions to answer:**
- What does this character do day-to-day?
- What do they believe about the world?
- What's missing or wrong in their current life (without them realizing it)?

**Example seed:**
"Elara was the best card trader in the market—detail-oriented, strategic, undefeated. But she played safe. Always the same decks, always the proven path."

---

### 2. THE CALL TO ADVENTURE (5% of story)

**What happens:**
Something disrupts the ordinary world. An opportunity, a threat, a mystery that can't be ignored.

**The call should:**
- Force choice (character *could* refuse, but cost matters)
- Raise stakes immediately (personal, emotional, or world-threatening)
- Connect to the character's hidden desire or flaw

**Example:**
"A stranger offered her a card—ancient, powerful, unstable. 'Its curse is spreading. You're the only one who can cleanse it.' Elara wanted to refuse. Safe was comfortable. But something in the stranger's eyes said refusing would haunt her."

---

### 3. REFUSAL OF THE CALL (Optional, 2-5%)

**What happens:**
Character hesitates or refuses. They state why the adventure is impossible/unwise.

**When to include:**
- If refusal creates dramatic tension
- If character needs to overcome real fear/doubt
- If refusal shows character flaw that adventure will address

**When to skip:**
- If acceptance is already reluctant
- If pacing needs to move faster
- If character is naturally action-oriented

**Example:**
"'I can't leave my shop. I can't abandon my life.' But even as Elara said it, she was already packing. The life she'd built felt like a cage she'd decorated too well."

---

### 4. MEETING THE MENTOR (5-10%)

**Who/What is the mentor?**
- A guide who believes in the character before they believe in themselves
- Could be a person, an object, an experience, or even the antagonist (unconventional)
- Provides crucial knowledge, weapon, or confidence

**The mentor:**
- Doesn't solve problems for the hero
- Teaches the hero *how* to solve them
- Often represents what the hero could become

**Example:**
"The stranger—who called herself Raven—didn't offer to cleanse the card herself. Instead, she gave Elara a map and a single instruction: 'You'll know what to do when you understand what the curse protects.'"

---

### 5. CROSSING THE THRESHOLD (5% of story)

**What is the threshold?**
The point of no return. Character commits to the adventure. The ordinary world is left behind.

**The threshold should:**
- Make returning to normal life impossible (or very costly)
- Be a deliberate choice by the character
- Visually or metaphorically mark the transition

**Example:**
"Elara walked past the last familiar street corner. She didn't look back. When she reached the Forest of Echoes, the path behind her vanished in mist. There was only forward now."

---

### 6. TESTS, ALLIES, AND ENEMIES (40% of story)

**What happens:**
Character navigates the special world. Challenges escalate. True nature of the quest becomes clear.

**Break this into 3-4 smaller challenges:**

**Challenge 1 (Introductory):**
- Low stakes
- Introduces rules of this world
- Character learns what they don't know
- Example: "First guardian demanded a trade: knowledge for safe passage"

**Challenge 2 (Complication):**
- Stakes rise
- Character makes a choice with consequences
- Introduces the subplot or emotional core
- Example: "The guardian was once cursed the same way. Elara realized the curse might not be evil—it might be protective."

**Challenge 3 (Dark Moment):**
- Highest stakes yet
- Character loses something important
- Forces confrontation with their central flaw
- Example: "The card's true form revealed itself—her own fear, made manifest. She'd been running from this her entire life."

**Allies and Enemies:**
- Allies: Who helps? Why? What do they want?
- Enemies: Who opposes? What do they represent (external obstacle vs. aspect of character's flaw)?
- Betrayal (optional): Does anyone switch sides? Why does it matter?

---

### 7. APPROACH TO THE INMOST CAVE (5-10%)

**What is the "Inmost Cave"?**
The place/moment of greatest fear. The final obstacle before climax.

**This phase:**
- Character prepares for the final challenge
- All learning from earlier phases is brought together
- Character must face their deepest doubt one more time
- Example: "Before the final chamber, Elara sat with the card. 'If I remove the curse, I remove the only thing protecting me from my own ambition. Am I ready for that?'"

---

### 8. THE ORDEAL (Climax - 10-15% of story)

**What is the ordeal?**
The central conflict reaches its peak. Character faces the antagonist (external) or their fear (internal) or both.

**The ordeal should:**
- Seem unwinnable before the character chooses the right path
- Force the character to use everything they've learned
- Reveal the character's growth since the beginning
- Change the character fundamentally (not just external situation)

**Types of ordeals:**
- **Combat/Physical:** Direct conflict with antagonist
- **Puzzle/Intellectual:** Solving a problem using knowledge gained
- **Moral/Emotional:** Choosing between two costly options
- **Mystical/Spiritual:** Confronting fear or truth directly

**Example:**
"Elara held the card at the edge of a flame that would purify it. One moment and the curse would burn away—but so would the protection. So would the girl she'd been. She'd become someone new. Afraid but unafraid. She let go."

---

### 9. THE REWARD (2-5%)

**What happens after the character survives the ordeal?**
- Character claims the reward (treasure, knowledge, self-understanding)
- Consequences of the choice become clear
- There's a moment of relief or clarification before the final push

**The reward is not the end goal—it's the proof the character has grown.**

**Example:**
"The card didn't break. It transformed. Where curse had been, there was clarity. Elara held something beautiful and dangerous in her hands. And she was ready for both."

---

### 10. THE ROAD BACK (5-10%)

**What is this?**
A second act of climax (optional but powerful). The character faces a final obstacle before returning home.

**Often involves:**
- A chase or pursuit (antagonist's last stand)
- A choice between continuing forward or going back
- Final test of whether character has truly changed

**When to use:** Longer stories that need extended climax.
**When to skip:** Shorter stories where ordeal IS the ending.

**Example:**
"As Elara fled, the sorcerer who'd cursed the card appeared. 'That power was meant for me!' But Elara no longer ran from power. She turned and faced him—not with violence, but with the hard clarity she'd found. 'It was never meant for anyone but the one strong enough to choose peace with it.'"

---

### 11. THE RESURRECTION (The Final Test - 5-10%)

**What is this?**
A final, definitive test that proves the character has truly transformed.

**Key element:** This test uses the character's *internal* growth, not just external victory.

**This phase:**
- Character faces consequences of their choices
- Final opportunity to abandon the growth (they could revert to old ways)
- Character chooses the harder path forward
- Symbolically, the character dies and is reborn as who they've become

**Example:**
"The sorcerer offered Elara a deal: return the card to him, and she could go back to her safe shop, her safe life. For a moment, she was tempted. Being ordinary was easier. But Elara had learned something: ordinary was a choice born from fear, and she was done choosing fear. She walked forward alone."

---

### 12. RETURN WITH THE ELIXIR (Resolution - 5-10%)

**What happens?**
Character returns to the ordinary world—changed by the journey. They bring wisdom, power, or transformation with them.

**The return includes:**
- What's different about the ordinary world now?
- How has the character changed?
- What will they do with their new understanding?
- What's the new normal?

**The elixir is not always physical.** It could be:
- Knowledge (understanding how to live differently)
- Wisdom (having learned an important truth)
- Transformation (being a different person)
- Sacrifice (having given something up for the greater good)

**Example:**
"Elara opened her shop again. But the shelves were different now—not just the safest cards, but cards that challenged her. She took risks. She taught her customers that safety without growth was just a smaller cage. And sometimes, when a stranger came asking for help with a cursed card, she would smile and say: 'I know someone who can help.'"
