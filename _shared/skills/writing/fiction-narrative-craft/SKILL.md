# Fiction & Narrative Craft

## About Storytelling

The best stories do three things simultaneously: they make you *care* (emotional investment), they make you *curious* (plot momentum), and they make you *understand* something you didn't before (thematic depth). This skill teaches you to build all three.

Whether you're creating a game quest, a world-building piece, a short story, or a narrative poem, the core principles remain: **establish stakes, complicate the situation, and resolve (or subvert) expectations with intention**.

## Core Principles

### 1. **Stakes Must Be Clear**
Every story needs a *why*. Why should the reader care about this character, this world, this situation?

- **Personal stakes:** What does the protagonist want/need? What happens if they fail?
- **World stakes:** What's wrong with the situation? What's being risked?
- **Thematic stakes:** What truth or question is being explored?

**Example (Splintermated context):** A quest isn't interesting because a player collects cards. It's interesting because that character *needs* those cards to prevent a magical disaster, and the reader wonders if they'll succeed despite growing obstacles.

### 2. **Character Agency Drives Plot**
Readers want to see characters *choose*, not just react. Decisions should be hard—choosing this path means losing that opportunity.

- **Avoid:** "The character realized they had no choice but to..."
- **Prefer:** "The character weighed the options: certain danger, probable death, or betraying the one person they trusted."

For game narratives especially: **player choice should feel meaningful**, not cosmetic. Different paths should have different consequences, even if they converge.

### 3. **Show, Then Tell**
Dialogue, action, and sensory detail reveal character and situation better than exposition ever will.

- **Weak:** "Elara was brave and determined."
- **Strong:** "Elara's hand trembled as she gripped the sword. She took a breath, steadied herself, and walked toward the dragon."

**Exception:** When you need to tell (for pace or efficiency), do it well: compress exposition into single vivid sentences.

### 4. **Pacing Balances Tension and Breathing Room**
Fast pacing (short sentences, quick scene changes) builds excitement. Slow pacing (longer sentences, description, reflection) allows reader immersion.

**Rhythm pattern:** Setup → tension build → moment of high intensity → brief breathing room → NEW tension build. Repeat.

**For games:** Quests should escalate challenge/stakes progressively, with occasional "success moments" to give players reward before the final challenge.

### 5. **World-Building Serves Story, Not Vice Versa**
Readers don't care about your magic system until it's *relevant*. Explain the minimum needed to understand the action; let players discover deeper lore through exploration and play.

- **Info-dump to avoid:** "In the age of Eldoria, the three moons symbolized balance between..."
- **Show instead:** "Under the third moon's red light, Elara knew the barrier would thin. This was her only chance."

### 6. **Dialogue Reveals Character, Advances Plot**
Good dialogue does multiple things at once:
- Shows how characters think/speak (personality)
- Reveals relationships (tone, what's unsaid)
- Moves action forward (shares information, creates conflict, makes decisions)

**Avoid:** "We need to leave." "Yes, let's leave." (No personality, no subtext)
**Prefer:** "We should run." "Run? You're the one who said courage was all that mattered."

## Before You Start: The Foundation

### 1. Define Your Core Conflict
What's the central problem, question, or challenge?
- **Internal conflict:** Character vs. themselves (doubt, desire, identity)
- **External conflict:** Character(s) vs. external force (antagonist, obstacle, impossible situation)
- **Thematic conflict:** Exploring opposing ideas (loyalty vs. freedom, ambition vs. contentment)

**Strong stories tangle all three.**

### 2. Identify Your Protagonist
Who is this story about? What do they *want* (external goal) vs. what do they *need* (internal growth)?

- **Want:** "I need to collect the Crystal of Fates to save my kingdom"
- **Need:** "I need to learn that I can't save everyone alone"

**The best arc:** Character pursues what they want, but achieving it requires becoming someone who needs what they wanted.

### 3. Know Your Ending
Not the exact details, but the *type*:
- **Triumph:** Character overcomes the obstacle; achieves want and/or need
- **Compromise:** Character gets *part* of what they want; grows in what they needed
- **Tragedy:** Character fails the external goal but gains internal insight
- **Ambiguous:** Outcome unclear; reader must determine meaning

**For games:** Consider branching endings. Different player choices → different outcomes. All should feel earned.

### 4. Establish Your Tone
Tone is the author's attitude toward the material. Is this:
- **Heroic and epic?** (Wonder, scale, nobility)
- **Dark and intense?** (Peril, moral complexity, high stakes)
- **Witty and clever?** (Humor, smart dialogue, self-aware)
- **Intimate and reflective?** (Personal, emotional, introspective)

**Tone consistency matters.** Sudden tonal shifts feel jarring unless *intentional* for effect.

## Structure: The Three-Act Journey

### Act I: Setup (25% of story)
**Goal:** Establish normal world, introduce protagonist, reveal what's wrong.

- Who is this character? (Show personality through action/choice)
- What is their world like? (Enough detail to understand stakes)
- What problem emerges? (Inciting incident—the thing that changes everything)
- Why can't they ignore it? (Stakes are personal and clear)

**Red flag:** If you're still explaining the world here, you're in exposition. Show through action.

### Act II: Complication (50% of story)
**Goal:** Deepen stakes, reveal character through struggle, escalate toward climax.

- Character pursues their goal
- Obstacles emerge (external: monsters, opponents, puzzles / internal: self-doubt, conflicting desires)
- Midpoint reversal: What they thought was true... isn't. Stakes rise.
- Series of escalating challenges; each failure raises the cost
- Dark moment: Character at their lowest point

**Pacing here is critical:** Vary scene length. Quick scenes build tension; longer scenes allow immersion.

**For games:** Each quest stage should introduce new mechanics/challenges, building player mastery.

### Act III: Resolution (25% of story)
**Goal:** Climactic challenge, resolution of main conflict, thematic payoff.

- Climactic confrontation (character vs. antagonist OR character vs. themselves/situation)
- Final choice: Character makes a decision that reveals everything they've learned
- Resolution: Consequences of that choice play out
- Denouement: Brief glimpse of new normal (or lack thereof if ending is ambiguous)

**Strong endings answer:** Did the character achieve their want? Did they grow into their need? What's the cost?

## Technique: Building Emotional Investment

### Create Specific Characters, Not Archetypes
Archetypes (*The Hero, The Mentor, The Shadow*) are useful starting points, but readers engage with specificity.

- **Weak:** "Elara was a skilled warrior with a tragic past"
- **Strong:** "Elara's left hand trembled since the fire—not from pain, but from shame. She trained right-handed with twice the ferocity, as if proving herself could burn away the memory"

**Specificity = humanity.** Specific details make characters feel real.

### Show Relationships Through Subtext
Best dialogue has layers. What characters *say* differs from what they *mean*.

```
WEAK: "I love you," Kael said tenderly.

STRONG: Kael studied the map. "Don't die," he said flatly.
Elara heard what wasn't spoken: Come back to me.
```

### Make Failure Meaningful
When characters fail, consequences follow. Failure creates plot momentum and reveals character.

- **Cosmetic failure:** Character fails, nothing changes
- **Meaningful failure:** Character fails, world shifts (loss, new information, new obstacles)

**Strongest moments:** Character succeeds in the wrong way (gets what they wanted but not what they needed) or fails in a way that teaches them.

### Use Sensory Detail Strategically
Don't describe everything. Choose *one vivid detail* per scene that grounds readers.

- **Weak:** "The tavern was crowded and loud"
- **Strong:** "Tavern noise crashed against Elara like surf—drink glasses clinking, laughter, someone retching in a corner. She focused on the bartender's scarred knuckles, the only stillness in the chaos"

**One detail per scene; make it *feel* something.*

## Game Narrative Integration (Optional)

If you're creating a quest or interactive narrative, consider these elements:

### Player Agency
- **Choice must matter:** Different paths → different consequences (story branching, unique dialogue, different challenges)
- **No false choices:** Don't offer options that lead to identical outcomes
- **Visible stakes:** Players understand what they're risking by choosing a path

### Progression & Pacing
- **Early quests:** Introduce mechanics and world, lower stakes
- **Mid-quests:** Escalate challenge and storytelling complexity
- **Late-quests:** Culmination, meaningful choices with lasting consequences

### Mechanical Integration
- **World rules must make sense:** If magic works a certain way, it works that way always (or explicit reasons why it breaks rules)
- **Challenge scales with player power:** Difficulty should feel earned, not arbitrary
- **Rewards align with effort:** Success should feel meaningful (narrative payoff, mechanical advantage, lore discovery)

### Quest Structure Pattern
```
Quest Hook: "The sorcerer has stolen the village's water supply"
↓
Quest Choice: "You can infiltrate the tower, negotiate with guards, or find another magic source"
↓
Challenge Stage 1: Introduction to a new environment/mechanic
↓
Challenge Stage 2: Escalation; things complicate
↓
Mid-Quest Decision: Player choice changes the path forward
↓
Challenge Stage 3: Final confrontation (boss, puzzle, moral dilemma)
↓
Resolution: Consequence of player's choices play out
↓
Closure: Quest complete with visible impact on world/story
```

## Writing Process

### Step 1: Outline Your Arc
Don't need prose yet. Answer these:
- What's the core conflict?
- What's the inciting incident (thing that starts everything)?
- What are 2-3 major complications that raise stakes?
- What's the climactic moment?
- What's the resolution and new normal?

### Step 2: Write Your First Draft Fast
- Don't self-edit yet
- Write conversationally; polish later
- If stuck, skip to next scene
- Aim for momentum, not perfection

### Step 3: Strengthen Structure
- Does each scene serve a purpose? (If not, cut or revise)
- Does pacing vary appropriately? (Quick scenes → slow scenes → quick scenes)
- Does Act III payoff what was setup in Acts I and II?

### Step 4: Deepen Character & Dialogue
- Read dialogue aloud (does it sound like people talk?)
- Where can you show instead of tell?
- Are character decisions clear and motivated?

### Step 5: Add Sensory & Emotional Detail
- One vivid detail per scene
- Sensory language (but not purple prose)
- Emotional beats (what does character feel in this moment?)

### Step 6: Final Polish
- Grammar, punctuation, clarity
- Cut unnecessary words
- Read aloud one more time

## Quality Checklist

Before you consider this done:

- [ ] **Protagonist is specific:** Readers could describe this character to someone else
- [ ] **Stakes are clear:** I understand what's at risk and why I should care
- [ ] **Dialogue sounds natural:** These characters sound like distinct people
- [ ] **One vivid detail per scene:** At least one sensory moment per major scene
- [ ] **Pacing varies:** Quick scenes alternate with slower, descriptive moments
- [ ] **Show > Tell:** Character revealed through action/choice, not description
- [ ] **Climax delivers:** The final challenge feels earned and meaningful
- [ ] **Ending answers the central question:** Thematic resolution, even if outcome is ambiguous
- [ ] **Tone is consistent:** Doesn't accidentally shift (unless intentional)
- [ ] **No unnecessary exposition:** World-building serves story, not vice versa
- [ ] **For games:** Player choices feel meaningful; consequences are visible

## Common Pitfalls

| Pitfall | Fix |
|---------|-----|
| **Passive protagonist** | Give your character an active goal and hard choices |
| **Info-dumping** | Explain minimum needed now; reveal rest through exploration/dialogue |
| **Telling feelings** | Show character action; let reader infer emotion |
| **Flat dialogue** | Give each character distinct voice/speech patterns |
| **No clear stakes** | Ask: "What happens if this character fails?" If answer is vague, stakes are weak |
| **Pacing drags** | Vary sentence length; alternate long descriptions with quick action |
| **Predictable plot** | Complicate things in Act II; surprise with a reversal or dark moment |
| **Ending feels abrupt** | Add denouement—brief scene showing new normal |

## Example: Splintermated Quest Narrative

**Setup:** Summoner has rare card but discovers it contains a cursed rune. Quest: Cleanse the card by retrieving components from three domains (Fire, Shadow, Nature). Each domain presents a moral choice.

**Act I:** Summoner learns the curse's origin. Stakes: Card is becoming unstable; if it breaks, the curse spreads.

**Act II:** Each domain reveals deeper truth: the curse wasn't malicious—it's a *protection*. Removing it exposes the card's true power *and* true danger. Mid-quest twist: The Summoner learns they *wanted* this protection for their own curse. Now what?

**Climax:** Summoner chooses: Remove the protection (card is powerful but exposed) or leave it (card is safe but limited). Each choice has mechanical and story consequences.

**Resolution:** New normal where Summoner understands their own fear and power differently.

**Player agency:** Every quest stage has 2-3 paths. Different paths reveal different lore about the card's origin. Climactic choice branches the ending. Multiple playthroughs = different stories.

**Ready to write?** Use the outline template in Reference Files, then start your first draft. This skill works best through *practice*—write messy drafts, revise aggressively, and let character voice emerge naturally.
