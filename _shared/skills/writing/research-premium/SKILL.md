# Research Premium Skill

## About Investment-Grade Analysis

Premium research is what Wall Street professionals use to make million-dollar decisions. It's **exhaustive, rigorous, visually polished, and actionable**.

This isn't just knowledge. It's *monetizable insight*—the kind that changes how organizations operate, where they invest, and what risks they accept.

Premium research requires:
- **Depth:** 5000+ words exploring the question from multiple angles
- **Rigor:** Sources validated; claims peer-checkable; methodology transparent
- **Foresight:** Predictive modeling; scenario analysis; early indicator identification
- **Professionalism:** Clean design; executive summary for skimming; supporting data for deep dives
- **Actionability:** Clear recommendations with implementation paths and success metrics

## Core Principles

### 1. **Monetizable Insight is Your North Star**

Every premium report answers: **"What should we do with this information, and what's the expected return?"**

Not just "Here's what's happening" but "Here's what this means for your strategy, and here's how we project the ROI."

- **Weak:** "AI market is growing rapidly"
- **Strong:** "AI infrastructure services market is growing 35% annually. Within 18 months, [company type] that doesn't offer AI services will lose [specific segment]. Competitive response: invest $X to capture $Y market share, with break-even in 24 months."

### 2. **Exhaustive Sourcing with Validation**

Premium research means you've talked to experts, reviewed primary data, and cross-validated claims.

- **Academic sources:** Peer-reviewed research, white papers
- **Expert interviews:** Direct conversations with 3+ specialists
- **Industry data:** Market reports, proprietary databases
- **Operational data:** Real-world metrics from practitioners
- **Contrarian sources:** 2-3 credible opposing perspectives

**Validation rule:** Any major claim appears in at least two independent sources. Outlier claims are clearly marked as such.

### 3. **Predictive Modeling Over Extrapolation**

Rather than "if current trends continue," premium analysis includes:
- **Scenario modeling:** "If X happens, then Y follows; if Z, then W"
- **Early indicators:** "Watch for these signals to validate/refute our projection"
- **Timeframe clarity:** "High confidence 6-month outlook; medium confidence 18-month; lower confidence 3-year"

### 4. **Risk Assessment is Explicit**

Premium analysis identifies:
- **Known risks:** Challenges everyone sees
- **Unknown risks:** Surprises that could upend your thesis
- **Mitigation strategies:** How to reduce exposure
- **Trigger points:** When to reassess if conditions change

### 5. **Design Communicates Professionalism**

Visual polish matters. This is read by executives in nice offices.

- **Executive dashboard:** Key metrics on first page
- **Clear navigation:** Table of contents with page numbers
- **Consistent formatting:** Headers, fonts, colors used predictably
- **Professional visuals:** Charts, maps, tables are clean and well-captioned
- **Readable margins:** Plenty of white space; not crowded
- **Color strategy:** 2-3 colors used consistently

## The Research Process

### Phase 1: Question Definition & Stakeholder Mapping (30-45 minutes)

**Your question:**
"What's the viable market for AI-powered supply chain optimization, and which companies should prioritize this?"

**Stakeholder mapping:**
| Stakeholder | Interest | Validation Need |
|---|---|---|
| Supply chain directors | Cost reduction, reliability | Will this reduce their headcount? Their risk? |
| Tech vendors | Market opportunity | How many potential customers? Revenue potential? |
| Investors | Market size & growth | When does this become mainstream? What's the TAM? |
| Risk managers | Implementation risk | What fails? What's the cost of failure? |

**Understand what each stakeholder cares about.** Your analysis must satisfy multiple audiences.

### Phase 2: Exhaustive Source Gathering (3-4 hours)

**Source categories:**
- **5-7 academic/research papers** (peer-reviewed, technical foundation)
- **8-12 industry reports** (market sizing, current deployments)
- **3-5 expert interviews** (direct conversations with practitioners, vendors, users)
- **10+ journalistic sources** (recent developments, real-world implementations)
- **2-3 contrarian analyses** (why this might fail; competing technologies)

**Total: 30+ sources minimum for a premium report.**

**Source tracking:**
```
[Source]
Type: [Academic/Industry/Interview/Journalistic/Contrarian]
Key Claim: [Main argument]
Evidence Quality: [Data? Case study? Opinion?]
Credibility: [Author expertise, peer review, recent]
Specific Finding for Question: [How does this inform your central question]
Conflicts with: [Other sources it contradicts, if any]
```

### Phase 3: Data & Modeling Synthesis (3-4 hours)

**Extract key data points:**
- Market size (current and projected)
- Growth rates (historical and forecasted)
- Adoption curves (early adopters, mainstream, laggards)
- Cost/benefit economics
- Success factors and failure modes

**Build scenarios:**
```
OPTIMISTIC CASE:
- If early indicators [X] appear by [date]
- And adoption accelerates beyond baseline
- Then market reaches [$X billion] by [year]
- ROI for early entrants: [Y%]
- Risk factors if this is wrong: [List]

BASE CASE:
- If current trends continue
- Market grows at [X%] annually
- Mainstream adoption in [X] years
- ROI: [Y%]

PESSIMISTIC CASE:
- If [key assumption] doesn't hold
- Or if [alternative technology] disrupts
- Market remains niche or shrinks
- ROI: negative or delayed
```

### Phase 4: Risk Mapping (2 hours)

**Known risks:**
- Competition from established players
- Regulatory uncertainty
- Implementation complexity
- Talent shortage

**Unknown risks:**
- Black swan event (major disruption)
- Paradigm shift (new technology makes this obsolete)
- Incentive misalignment (problem harder than expected)

**Mitigation strategies:**
- Diversified vendor relationships
- Built-in exit clauses
- Staged implementations (reduce upfront commitment)
- Continuous monitoring (early signals of model breakdown)

### Phase 5: Writing & Design (6-8 hours)

### SECTION 7: STRATEGIC RECOMMENDATIONS (400-600 words)

**What should you do?**

**If you're a supply chain organization:**
"Pilot with top-tier vendor (A or B) in 6-month engagement. Investment: $250K-500K. Success metric: 15%+ cost reduction. Decision point at 3 months: continue or pivot. If pilot succeeds, plan 18-month full deployment."

**If you're a vendor:**
"Focus on vertical integration (specific industries) rather than horizontal (all use cases). Acquire 2-3 point solution vendors to broaden capabilities. Plan for consolidation; positioning for acquisition improves valuation."

**If you're an investor:**
"Tier 1 vendors have captured most value; returns limited. Tier 2 vendors show promise; identify 1-2 with specific vertical strength. Scenario probability favors mainstream adoption; risk is worth taking for 3-5 year horizon."

### SECTION 8: IMPLEMENTATION ROADMAP (300-400 words)

**If someone decides to move forward, what's the path?**

**Phase 1 (Months 1-3): Evaluation**
- Select 2-3 vendors for pilot
- Define success metrics
- Prepare internal stakeholders
- Budget: $50K-100K

**Phase 2 (Months 3-6): Pilot**
- Run parallel test (new system alongside current)
- Measure against defined metrics
- Identify integration points
- Budget: $150K-300K

**Phase 3 (Months 6-18): Deployment**
- Full implementation based on pilot results
- Training and change management
- Integration with ERP/existing systems
- Budget: $300K-800K+

**Success indicators:**
- Cost reduction: 15%+ within 6 months post-deployment
- System adoption: 80%+ of users active within 3 months
- Integration: <5% of data quality issues

### SECTION 9: MONITORING & DECISION POINTS (300-400 words)

**How do we know if our analysis holds? When should we reassess?**

**Early indicators to watch (0-6 months):**
- Vendor funding and M&A activity
- Enterprise adoption announcements

- Regulatory developments (any new regulations affecting supply chains?)

**Mid-term indicators (6-18 months):**
- Actual cost savings in early deployments
- Vendor technology roadmaps (what's next?)
- New entrants or disruptions
- Market growth rate vs. projection

**Reassessment triggers:**
- If actual growth rate is 20% below projection for 3+ months
- If 2+ major vendors fail or are acquired under distress
