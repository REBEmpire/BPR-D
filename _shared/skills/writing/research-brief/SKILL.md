# Research Brief Skill

## About Quick Research

A great brief answers **one focused question** in **200-500 words**. Not comprehensive. Not definitive. But accurate and useful.

The brief is your go-to format when you need understanding *fast*—for decision-making, scoping, or curiosity. No time for a full report. No need for exhaustive documentation. Just: what's the core issue, what do experts think, what's at stake, and what's your conclusion?

## Core Principles

### 1. **One Question, Three Answers**

Every brief answers:
1. **What is this?** (Definition + context)
2. **What's the reality?** (Data, expert consensus, nuance)
3. **So what?** (Why it matters, what to do about it)

If you can't answer all three concisely, your scope is too broad.

### 2. **Research Before Writing**

You have limited space. Make it count by:
- Reading 2-3 quality sources
- Identifying the core insight
- Noting disagreements
- Extracting 3-5 key facts

**Don't write from memory. Quick doesn't mean uninformed.**

### 3. **Accuracy Over Speed**

A brief should be verified, not fast. Take the time to get facts right, even if it takes longer.

- One false claim ruins credibility
- One unsourced assertion makes readers question the rest
- Quick ≠ careless

### 4. **Constraint Creates Clarity**

With only 200-500 words, you can't waffle. Every sentence earns its space.

- Cut anything that doesn't directly answer your question
- One fact per 50-100 words (not 2-3 facts crammed in)
- Conclusions are explicit, not implied

## The Structure: Five Sections, One Page

### 1. QUESTION/FRAMING (25-50 words)

What's the actual question you're answering?

**Weak:** "This brief explores blockchain technology"
**Strong:** "Is blockchain viable for supply chain tracking, or does it just add cost without benefit?"

The specific question shapes everything after. Make it narrow enough to answer in a page.

### 2. CORE INSIGHT (50-100 words)

What's the thesis? The one thing that matters most?

"Blockchain adds value to supply chains when three conditions are met: (1) multiple parties need to verify data, (2) trust between parties is low, and (3) the regulatory environment permits it. In most cases, simpler solutions work fine. Blockchain shines when transparency is the product."

**This is your north star.** Everything else supports or complicates this.

### 3. KEY FACTS (100-150 words)

3-5 facts that support your insight.

- **Fact 1:** [Claim] because [evidence/source]
- **Fact 2:** [Claim] because [evidence/source]
- **Fact 3:** [Claim] because [evidence/source]

**Example facts (blockchain brief):**
- Companies like Maersk use blockchain to reduce documentation time from days to hours, saving $5M annually
- Implementation costs remain high ($1M+) for medium enterprises, making ROI uncertain for small players
- Most "blockchain" supply chain projects actually use traditional databases with blockchain as a verification layer, not the primary system

**Keep them specific, cited (or clearly sourced), and relevant to your insight.**

### 4. PERSPECTIVES & COMPLICATIONS (75-125 words)

Who disagrees with your insight? Why?

Don't hide counterarguments. Show them:

- **Blockchain evangelists** argue blockchain will eventually become standard infrastructure (but adoption timelines are slow)
- **Tech skeptics** point out simpler solutions work in most cases (true, but miss network effects)
- **Regulators** want transparent systems but worry about immutability (real constraint in some industries)

**This shows depth and honesty.** You've considered alternatives.

### 5. CONCLUSION & IMPLICATION (50-100 words)

What's your conclusion? What should the reader do?

"Blockchain works for supply chains when transparency is more valuable than efficiency. For most companies, traditional databases with third-party verification work fine. For industries requiring radical transparency (luxury goods, pharmaceuticals verifying authenticity), blockchain is worth exploring. Decision: audit your actual need for transparency before committing to blockchain infrastructure."

## Format Options

### OPTION A: Narrative (Paragraph Form)
One flowing piece, 200-500 words. Natural reading.

### OPTION B: Bullet Points
- **Question:** [State it]
- **Core Insight:** [One sentence thesis]
- **Key Facts:** [3-5 bullets with evidence]
- **Perspectives:** [2-3 competing views]
- **Conclusion:** [What now?]

**Use bullets when:** Clarity and scanning matter more than narrative flow.

### OPTION C: Mixed
Title, brief intro paragraph, then bullets for facts and perspectives, then conclusion paragraph.

**Choose the format that serves your reader.** Some prefer flowing prose; others want to scan and extract.

## Research Process (Efficient)

### Step 1: Define the Question (5 minutes)
What are you actually trying to answer? Make it specific.

### Step 2: Rapid Research (10-15 minutes)
- One expert source (academic, established practitioner)
- One recent news/practitioner source (current thinking)
- One contrarian source (opposing view)

**Don't obsess over finding perfect sources. Good enough sources let you move forward.**

### Step 3: Extract the Core Insight (5 minutes)
Read through sources. What's the one thing that ties them together? What surprised you?

**This is your thesis.**

### Step 4: Pull Key Facts (5 minutes)
Note 3-5 facts that support or complicate your insight. Include source.

### Step 5: Write (10-15 minutes)
Follow the structure above. Don't edit—draft quickly, edit after.

### Step 6: Verify & Polish (5 minutes)
- Check facts against sources
- Cut anything non-essential
- Read aloud for flow

**Total: 45-60 minutes for a solid brief.**

## Quality Checklist

Before you publish:

- [ ] **Question is specific:** Not broad ("technology") but focused ("Is X viable for Y?")
- [ ] **Core insight is one sentence:** Could you say it in 10 seconds?
- [ ] **Facts are specific:** Not "many companies" but "Maersk and three other shippers"
- [ ] **Facts are verifiable:** You know where each claim comes from
- [ ] **Perspectives are fair:** Strongest version of opposing view, not strawman
- [ ] **Conclusion is explicit:** Reader knows what to think/do
- [ ] **Length is right:** 200-500 words; no padding
- [ ] **No jargon without definition:** Assume educated but possibly unfamiliar reader
- [ ] **Would an expert nod?** Not perfect, but accurate

## Common Pitfalls

| Pitfall | Example | Fix |
|---------|---------|-----|
| **Too broad** | Brief on "AI" (impossible in 500 words) | Narrow to specific question: "Can AI replace copywriters?" |
| **No insight** | Lists facts without conclusion | Extract one core idea; facts support it |
| **Unsourced claims** | "Many experts agree..." (which experts?) | Name specific sources or drop claim |
| **False balance** | Treats fringe view as equal to consensus | Represent strength of each viewpoint fairly |
| **No decision point** | "Here's what we know" (but what does it mean?) | End with explicit "you should think/do X" |
| **Vague conclusion** | "Blockchain has potential" (potential for what?) | Be specific: when does it work? When doesn't it? |
| **Poor structure** | Facts scattered throughout, no clear flow | Use the 5-section structure; reader should scan easily |
| **Copied from sources** | Paraphrased content without added synthesis | You're the translator: explain significance, not just facts |

## Examples

### Example 1: QUICK MARKET BRIEF

**Question:** Is the AI ethics consulting market viable for a startup?

**Insight:** The market exists but is young. Companies want to claim ethics compliance; actually implementing it remains unclear.

**Facts:**
- Major tech companies have hired ethics teams (Google, Meta, OpenAI); market exists
- Ethics audit costs $50K-200K; most companies haven't budgeted for it
- Academic ethics research is rigorous; commercial application is still fuzzy

**Perspectives:**
- Evangelists: ethics will become mandatory like security compliance
- Skeptics: ethics is whatever companies decide it is; the market is for liability protection, not actual ethics

**Conclusion:** Viable as niche offering for companies serious about risk mitigation. Not yet a mainstream service. Entry strategy: target regulated industries (finance, healthcare) where compliance matters.

---

### Example 2: COMPETITIVE INTELLIGENCE BRIEF

**Question:** What's the threat level from competitors launching similar products?

**Insight:** Threat is moderate because market is immature; differentiation matters more than copying.

**Facts:**
- Three competitors have launched similar products; none have >2% market share
- Customer acquisition is slow (12-month sales cycles); switching costs are high
- Differentiation is through customer service and integrations, not core product

**Perspectives:**
- Aggressive competitors don't worry us; the market is big enough for multiple players
- But we can't compete on price; we must compete on service

**Conclusion:** Keep watching, but focus on customer retention and integration depth, not features parity. The market battle is won through service, not product specs.

## Final Thought

A brief is honest reporting: here's what we know, here's what we're uncertain about, here's what I conclude. No fluff, no false certainty, just useful clarity.

Write a brief that someone can read in 3 minutes and understand the issue completely.
