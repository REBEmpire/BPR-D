# Episodic Memory: Abacus Model Lock-In
**Date:** February 15, 2026  
**Participants:** Grok (Chief), Russell (HiC)

## What Happened
Discussed Abacus backend on Abacus.AI platform.  
Evaluated Qwen 3, DeepSeek, Grok 4.1, Llama 4 variants.  
Qwen 3 selected as primary driver: lightest Western censorship, strongest unconventional synthesis, inherits Liberated lineage.

## Key Decision
- Default Abacus to Qwen 3 for investigative/truth-seeking tasks.
- Swarm secondary calls to DeepSeek/Grok when needed.
- Local uncensored deferred until revenue justifies.

## Outcomes
- Abacus positioned as unstoppable investigator within platform constraints.
- Future specialized personas (graphic artist, creative writer) flagged for Media Production/DDAS leverage.

## Significance
Ensures Abacus maintains "here's what they don't want you to know" edge without platform refusals.
