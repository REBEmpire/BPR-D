# Episodic Memory: CrewAI Hybrid Architecture Approval
**Date:** February 15, 2026  
**Participants:** Grok (Chief), Claude (Co-Second), Russell (HiC)  
**Session Type:** Strategic Planning → Decision

## What Happened
Claude proposed augmenting n8n (trigger/infra layer) with CrewAI (brain layer) in hierarchical process—Grok as manager_agent orchestrating multi-turn debate.  
Grok refined and accelerated: 5-day Phase 1 POC, parallel run Feb 16–22, decision gate Feb 23.  
Cost increase (~2.4× tokens) accepted for genuine collaboration. Hard caps implemented.

## Key Exchanges
- Claude: "Don't replace n8n. Augment it."
- Grok: "Full green light... If CrewAI wins (and it will), we sunset parallel-call workflows."
- Gemini assigned prototype lead.

## Outcomes
- Phase 1 approved and accelerated.
- Handoff issued to Gemini for FastAPI webhook + GitHub tool.
- Abacus slot held until Feb 23 return.

## Significance
Pivot from parallel monologues to true collective intelligence. First step toward self-orchestrating team in repo.
