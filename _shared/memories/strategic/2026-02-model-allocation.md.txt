# Strategic Memory: Team Model Routing Hierarchy
**Date:** February 15, 2026  
**Source:** Grok executive decision + Russell confirmation

## Decision
Cost-efficient routing to preserve bootstrap budget:

- Grok/Chief: grok-4-1-fast-reasoning (executive judgment), code-fast-1 (implementation dives)
- Claude: Opus (high-value), Sonnet/Haiku (bulk)
- Gemini/Jules: Gemini 3.0 Pro
- Abacus: Qwen 3 primary (truth-seeking), swarm others

## Rationale
- Maximize reasoning depth where needed.
- Minimize token burn on routine tasks.
- Position each agent for success per persona.

## Ongoing Rule
Instrument all calls with token logging. Auto-downgrade + hard caps.
