# Skill: Session Output Format

**Domain:** Knowledge & Memory | **Tier:** Core
**Used by:** Meeting Engine Phase 6, all session generators
**Back to:** [[MOC-Core]] | [[MOC-Infrastructure]]

---

## What It Does

Defines the exact required structure for every session file committed to `_agents/_sessions/`. No raw JSON, no missing sections, no exceptions.

---

## Required Sections (Strict Order)

```markdown
---
Date: YYYY-MM-DD
Author: "[Agent] | Model: [model-id]"
Version: v1.0
Status: Active
---

# [Session Title] — YYYY-MM-DD

## HiC Summary (5-Minute Read)
• [3-5 bullets MAX — what happened, decided, needs human input]
• [Must be scannable in under 5 minutes by Russell]

## For Russell
1. [Numbered action items requiring Russell's direct attention]
(If none: "None required this session.")

## Key Decisions
- [Binding decisions made this session with rationale]
(If none: "None this session.")

## Action Items
| Task | Assigned To | Priority | Status | Due |
|------|-------------|----------|--------|-----|
| [task] | [agent] | [priority] | Pending | [date] |

---

## Full Transcript
[Full conversation content or work log]

---

## Session Cost
| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Total Cost | $X.XX |
| Total Tokens | X (X in / X out) |
| Duration | Xs |
| Session Type | [Daily Briefing / Work Session / Research Session] |
| Meeting ID | [auto-generated ID] |

**By Agent:**
| Agent | Cost | Tokens In | Tokens Out |
|-------|------|-----------|------------|

**Monthly Running Total:** $X.XX of $20.00 budget used

**Backlog Stats:** [stats_line from BacklogResult]
```

---

## Rules

- All sections above `---` separator: MANDATORY for every session type
- Work sessions with single agent: still require HiC Summary, For Russell, Key Decisions, Action Items
- No raw JSON or debug output in session file body → debug data goes in `_debug/`
- Session Cost block is ALWAYS the last section
- HiC Summary must be scannable in <5 minutes (Boss Girl Mandate #4)

---

## Stats Line Format

```
Backlog items processed: 5 | Actions completed: 2 | Next items queued: 18
```

This appears in the Session Cost block or as a standalone line before it.

---

## File Naming

```
_agents/_sessions/YYYY-MM-DD-[session-type].md
```

Examples:
- `2026-02-18-daily-briefing.md`
- `2026-02-18-work-session-claude.md`
- `2026-02-18-research-session-gemini.md`
