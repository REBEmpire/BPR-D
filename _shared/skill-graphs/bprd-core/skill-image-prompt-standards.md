# Skill: Image Prompt Standards

**Domain:** Research Pipelines | **Tier:** Core
**Used by:** All agents creating Hive-eligible content
**Back to:** [[MOC-Core]] | [[MOC-Research]]

---

## What It Does

Defines style guidelines, source priority, and prompt structure for all BPR&D visual assets. Consistent visual language = recognizable brand.

---

## Style Palette (Non-Negotiable)

**Approved styles:**
1. **Cyberpunk** — Neon-lit cityscapes, rain-slicked streets, augmented humans, holograms
2. **Retro-Futuristic** — 70s/80s sci-fi aesthetic, chrome and chrome, analog meets digital
3. **Glitch Art** — Data corruption aesthetics, pixel scatter, RGB shift, scan lines
4. **Macro Photography** — Ultra-close detail shots with dramatic lighting (for conceptual images)

**Color palette:** Neon blues, purples, greens, magentas against dark backgrounds. High contrast.

**BANNED:** Stock photo aesthetic, corporate clipart, generic office settings, anything that looks like it came from Canva's free tier.

## Prompt Structure

Strong image prompts include:
```
[Subject] [Action/State], [Style], [Lighting], [Mood], [Technical specs]

Example:
"Hooded hacker in neon-lit underground data center,
cyberpunk aesthetic, blue and purple neon reflections on rain-wet floors,
cinematic atmosphere with dramatic shadows,
photorealistic 8K render"
```

For conceptual/abstract:
```
"Abstract visualization of [concept], glitch art aesthetic,
data corruption patterns, neon color palette,
high contrast digital art"
```

---

## Source Priority

1. **Grok Imagine** — Team-owned, preferred. Free, on-brand, no licensing issues.
2. **Gemini image generation** — High quality, good style adherence.
3. **Abacus AI image generation** — Available post-Feb 23.
4. **Open source / free-to-use** — Pexels, Unsplash (search for dark/neon/tech), Wikimedia Commons for historical content.

**Note:** Never use stock photo sites that require attribution per-use or have restrictive commercial licenses.
