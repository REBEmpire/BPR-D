# Skill: Meeting Engine Orchestration

**Domain:** Orchestration | **Tier:** Core
**Used by:** crewai-service/meetings/, work_session jobs
**Back to:** [[MOC-Core]] | [[MOC-Infrastructure]]

---

## What It Does

The Meeting Engine is a **phase-driven state machine** that produces multi-agent conversations with full conversational coherence. It is NOT a task-delegation system — it is a dialogue orchestrator.

---

## Phase Sequence

```
Phase 0: Context Assembly
    ├── Load agent profiles from _agents/[agent]/profile.md
    ├── Load agent context from _agents/[agent]/context/active.md
    ├── Run backlog/discovery.py → top-5 items
    ├── Load relevant skill sub-graph (see [[skill-prompt-injection-runtime]])
    └── Assemble full context block

Phase 1: Grok Opens
    └── Grok receives context → generates opening (never predictable)

Phase 2: Agent Round
    ├── Each agent receives: context + full transcript so far
    ├── Grok's opening is part of the transcript
    └── Response order: Claude → Gemini → (Abacus if active)

Phase 3: Debate
    ├── Claude and Abacus engage directly
    ├── Gemini provides data/research backing
    └── Grok intervenes if circular

Phase 4: Grok Synthesizes
    └── Grok receives full transcript → extracts decisions + action items

Phase 5: Grok Closes
    └── Memorable close, never repeated pattern

Phase 6: Post-Processing
    ├── Format session file (_agents/_sessions/YYYY-MM-DD-*.md)
    ├── Update agent handoff.md tables
    ├── Commit to GitHub
    └── Send Telegram alert if handoffs exist
```

## Key Design Insight

> "Full conversation transcript passed to each agent enables natural multi-turn dialogue."

Every agent call gets the COMPLETE transcript of all previous turns. This is why the conversations feel coherent — not because of stateful memory in the service, but because each call includes everything that came before.

---

## Cost Controls

- Hard cap: $0.75 per meeting
- Budget: $20/month team total
- Per-agent: Grok $5, Claude $6, Gemini $5, Abacus $4
- Token counting: actual counts from API responses (not estimated)

See [[skill-cost-governance]] for full rules.

## Session Output Requirements

Every session file MUST include (in order):
1. YAML front-matter
2. `## HiC Summary` (3-5 bullets, <5 min read)
3. `## For Russell` (numbered action items)
4. `## Key Decisions`
5. `## Action Items` (table)
6. `---`
7. `## Full Transcript`
8. `---`
9. `## Session Cost` (always last)

See [[skill-session-output-format]] for exact format.
