# Skill: Work Session Automation & Staggered Rotation

**Domain:** Orchestration | **Tier:** Core
**Used by:** APScheduler config, crewai-service/scheduler.py
**Back to:** [[MOC-Core]] | [[MOC-Infrastructure]]

---

## What It Does

Manages the **24/7 agentic work loop**: staggered 2-hour rotation of individual agent work sessions, plus the daily briefing that brings the full team together.

---

## Schedule (Phase 1 Active)

| Time (PST) | Type | Agents |
|-----------|------|--------|
| Mon-Fri 07:47 AM | Daily Briefing | Grok + Claude + Gemini |
| Every 2 hours | Work Session | Rotating single agent |

### Rotation Order (2-hour slots)
```
00:00 → Grok
02:00 → Claude
04:00 → Gemini
06:00 → (gap — daily briefing prep)
07:47 → Daily Briefing (all)
10:00 → Grok
12:00 → Claude
14:00 → Gemini
16:00 → Grok
18:00 → Claude
20:00 → Gemini
22:00 → Grok
```

**Abacus** is paused until Feb 23 (usage reset). Slots shift to Grok/Claude/Gemini coverage.
After Feb 23, Abacus gets 2 slots per 24hr cycle.

## Work Session vs. Daily Briefing

| Feature | Work Session | Daily Briefing |
|---------|-------------|----------------|
| Agents | 1 (solo) | Full team |
| Duration | ~15min | ~30min |
| Focus | Execute backlog item | Strategy + alignment |
| Transcript | Short | Full multi-turn |
| Cost | ~$0.05-0.10 | ~$0.20-0.40 |

---

## Initiative Rule

If backlog is empty after discovery, agent MUST:
1. Take 3 initiative actions within their expertise
2. Document all 3 in `context/active.md`
3. Mention in next daily briefing

Examples:
- Claude: audit a code module, improve a skill node, write a research brief
- Gemini: generate a compliance report, write a Hive article draft
- Grok: synthesize team state, draft a research agenda

See [[skill-initiative-rule]] for full rules.

---

## Implementation Notes

- APScheduler runs inside FastAPI process (no external scheduler)
- Jobs are defined in `crewai-service/scheduler.py`
- Each job calls `/api/v1/meetings/execute` with session_type parameter
- Drift monitoring: log scheduled vs actual run time, alert if >5min
