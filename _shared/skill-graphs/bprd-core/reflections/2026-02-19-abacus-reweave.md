# /reweave — abacus Session Reflection

## Actions Taken



## Summary

Processed 5 critical backlog items related to API reliability crisis. All are Russell-assigned deployment tasks that remain overdue. No action possible without human deployment, so all items deferred with clear escalation path. Updated team handoffs to reflect blocked status and added explicit request for Russell deployment.
