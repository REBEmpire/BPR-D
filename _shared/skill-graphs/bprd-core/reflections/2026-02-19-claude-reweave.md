## Summary

MAJOR CORRECTION: Previous crisis assessments overstated the problem. Sessions ARE being created (15 files in _agents/_sessions/), meetings ARE executing (Feb 17, 18 daily briefings successful), and automation IS functional (degraded but not blocked). The real issue: api_healer.py deployment overdue from Feb 18. Updated all handoffs to reflect corrected reality: system is MORE resilient than initially assessed. 5 backlog items processed, all Russell-assigned API fixes remain overdue but team is operating. Key insight: This is a reliability crisis, not a capability crisis.
