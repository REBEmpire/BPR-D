## Summary

Completed comprehensive strategic review of BPR&D's API infrastructure crisis (Feb 17-19). Key finding: Feb 18 Daily Briefing executed successfully with all 3 agents, proving meeting engine resilience despite 50% API failure rate. Updated team_state.md with crisis timeline, created recovery framework, updated all agent handoffs with contingency plans. Created new Russell handoff consolidating crisis assessment and recovery path. Critical blocker: api_healer.py deployment pending Russell action. All agents ready to resume full operations post-deployment. Crisis is infrastructure deployment bottleneck, not agent capability issue.
