## Summary

Processed 5 critical Russell handoffs (all overdue API fixes). Created comprehensive Post-Crisis Recovery Protocol with 6-phase validation checklist (30+ concrete steps). Updated all 4 agent handoffs with crisis context and recovery priorities. Key discovery: Feb 18 Daily Briefing executed successfully - meeting engine proven resilient during infrastructure stress. Core blocker identified: api_healer.py deployment (Russell). Repository audit revealed deployment gaps (healer/guardians not in repo). All agents ready to resume full operations once infrastructure stabilizes. Recovery Protocol provides systematic validation framework.
