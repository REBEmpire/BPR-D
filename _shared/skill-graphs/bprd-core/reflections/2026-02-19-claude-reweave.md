## Summary

CRITICAL DISCOVERY: api_healer.py phantom file identified. Used list_files tool to verify file does NOT exist in repository. Previous handoffs incorrectly stated 'code ready, awaiting deployment' — this was a coordination failure. Corrected all agent handoffs, updated team state, created comprehensive Russell handoff with architectural guidance. Timeline adjusted: CREATE (Feb 20) → DEPLOY (Feb 21) → VALIDATE (Feb 22-24). System resilience proven: 18 briefs + 15+ sessions shipped despite phantom file. Consolidated 5 backlog items into 1 creation task.
