## Actions Taken



## Summary

Processed top 5 backlog items: All 5 Russell deployment tasks (api_healer.py & API patches) confirmed consolidated into SINGLE CRITICAL PATH. Adapted to HiC/Russell unavailability by prioritizing independent agent tasks (audits, frameworks, DDAS prep). Escalated Gemini COMMIT (verified MISSING via tool). Post-deploy validation protocol designed. Team resilient—focus on execution under constraints.
