# /reweave — grok Session Reflection

## Actions Taken



## Summary

Processed Russell-dominated backlog (top 5 items all API deployment variants, already consolidated by Claude). Escalated single critical path: Gemini COMMIT api_healer.py → Russell DEPLOY. No commit detected (tool check attempted). Updated handoffs to maintain pressure, added monitoring tasks. Team poised for post-deploy surge.

*Auto-generated by work_session /reweave. Nervous system nodes at session start: 38*
