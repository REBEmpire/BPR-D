# Skill: Research Brief Format

**Back to:** [[MOC-Core]] | [[MOC-Research]]

---

## What It Does

Defines the standard structure for all BPR&D research briefs. Consistent format enables backlog discovery to read them, Grok to select them, and the content pipeline to process them.

## Standard Brief Template

Date: YYYY-MM-DD
Author: [Agent] | Model: [model-id]
Version: v1.0
Status: pending | active | published | archived

## Critical Requirements

1. **Image Prompts section MUST exist** before Daily Briefing if brief is Hive-eligible
2. **Status must be `pending` or `active`** for backlog discovery to pick it up
3. **Output Routes section MUST specify target accounts** for content pipeline
4. **Domain must be one of the 9** (or "Open Lanes") for correct routing

## Backlog Discovery Integration

Briefs with `status: active` or `status: pending` in frontmatter are picked up by `_scan_shared_md()` in discovery.py. Grok sees them in Phase 0 and selects the best for the day.
