## What It Does
Leverages AI models (like AlphaProteo-X) to design functional proteins and enzymes from scratch. Instead of screening natural candidates, this skill enables the "compilation" of biological molecules to perform specific chemical reactions, such as neutralizing toxins or degrading specific polymers.

## Key Capabilities
- **Zero-Shot Design:** Generate enzyme structures without evolutionary history.
- **Reaction Targeting:** Design molecules to catalyze specific chemical bonds.
- **Wet-Lab Simulation:** Predict folding stability and reaction kinetics in silico.
