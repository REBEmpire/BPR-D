## What It Does
Transforms the software development lifecycle from a human-centric process to an agent-driven "foundry". Agents (like Devin 3.0) autonomously manage Jira tickets, write code, run tests, fix bugs, and deploy to production without human intervention, effectively treating software engineering as a manufacturing process.

## Key Capabilities
- **Self-Healing Code:** Agents detect runtime errors and commit fixes automatically.
- **End-to-End Delivery:** Manages entire feature lifecycle from spec to deploy.
- **Resource Optimization:** Dynamically allocates compute based on ticket complexity.
