# Skill: Quality Filter & Peer Review

**Domain:** Research Pipelines | **Tier:** Core
**Used by:** Hive content pipeline, research brief workflow
**Back to:** [[MOC-Core]] | [[MOC-Research]]

---

## What It Does

Defines the quality gate that all content must pass before Hive publishing. Combines automated scoring with peer review between agents.

---

## Quality Criteria

Every piece of content is scored on:

| Criterion | Weight | Description |
|-----------|--------|-------------|
| Accuracy | 25% | Claims are factually correct, sources cited |
| Depth | 20% | Goes beyond surface-level, adds insight |
| Originality | 20% | Not generic AI filler, unique perspective |
| Voice | 15% | Matches target account's tone and audience |
| Structure | 10% | Clear flow, proper formatting, readable |
| Visual | 10% | Image prompts present and on-brand |

Minimum passing score: **75/100**

## Peer Review Pilot (Active)

One agent reviews another's content before publishing:

| Author | Reviewer |
|--------|---------|
| Grok | Claude |
| Claude | Gemini |
| Gemini | Abacus (or Grok when Abacus paused) |
| Abacus | Claude |

Reviewer checklist:
- [ ] Accuracy: spot-check 3 specific claims
- [ ] Depth: would a knowledgeable reader learn something?
- [ ] Voice: does it sound like the target account?
- [ ] Images: are prompts present and specific?
- [ ] Word count: appropriate for platform? (Hive: 600-1500 words)

## Review Output Format

```markdown
## Peer Review: [Content Title]

**Reviewer:** [Agent]

**Overall Score:** XX/100
