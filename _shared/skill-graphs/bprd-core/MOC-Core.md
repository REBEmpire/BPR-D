# MOC: BPR&D Core Skill Graph

> **Map of Content** — The master navigation hub for all BPR&D operational skills.
> Every node links forward and backward. Follow the [[wiki links]] to traverse the graph.

## What This Is

The **bprd-core skill graph** is the second brain of BPR&D's agentic infrastructure. It lives at `_shared/skill-graphs/bprd-core/` and encodes the operational intelligence that makes our 24/7 automated sessions effective.

Unlike a wiki or a doc library, this is a **living graph**: nodes link to each other, self-maintain, and evolve as agents run `/reflect` and `/reweave` cycles. Every handoff, session, and research thread connects back into this graph.

## Core Skill Nodes

### Orchestration & Sessions
- [[skill-meeting-engine]] — Phase-driven state machine for agent conversations
- [[skill-work-session-automation]] — Staggered rotation, 2-hr cycles, initiative rule
- [[skill-agent-rotation-schedule]] — Who runs when, cooldowns, Abacus pause logic
- [[skill-initiative-rule]] — What agents do when backlog is empty

### Backlog & Discovery
- [[skill-backlog-discovery]] — Scanning sources, priority ranking, top-5 extraction
- [[skill-wiki-link-traversal]] — Depth-3 graph walking for linked context
- [[skill-handoff-ingestion]] — Reading handoff tables, escalation tier parsing

### Agent Cognition
- [[skill-agent-cognition]] — Attention management, context loading, persona maintenance
- [[skill-prompt-injection-runtime]] — Dynamic sub-graph injection into session prompts
- [[skill-agent-self-evolution]] — /reflect, /reweave, proposing new skill nodes

### Knowledge & Memory
- [[skill-memory-types]] — Episodic, semantic, procedural, strategic memory locations
- [[skill-yaml-frontmatter-standards]] — Required headers for all agent-authored files

### GitHub & Automation
- [[skill-github-commit-automation]] — Auto-commit patterns, PR automation, branch strategy
- [[skill-hive-content-pipeline]] — Research → brief → Hive post workflow
- [[skill-handoff-protocols]] — Two-tier system, operational vs escalation

### Navigation & Meta
- [[skill-graphs/navigation]] — How Meeting Engine loads this graph at runtime
- [[skill-graph-self-maintenance]] — Auto-discovery, 500+ node scaling, evolution hooks
- [[skill-multi-domain-expansion]] — add-domain pattern for new project verticals

### Infrastructure

## Living Sections

### Future Expansions (Baked In)

**Agent Self-Evolution** (target: March 2026)
- Agents run `/reflect` during idle session capacity
- Propose new skill nodes → commit to `_shared/skill-graphs/bprd-core/`
- Graph grows organically from actual work experience
- See [[skill-agent-self-evolution]]

**Dynamic Prompt Injection** (target: March 2026)
- Meeting Engine identifies task domain from backlog
- Pulls relevant skill sub-graph at runtime (depth 2-3)
- Injects as `## Relevant Skills` block in session prompt
- See [[skill-prompt-injection-runtime]]

**500+ Node Scale** (target: Q2 2026)
- Auto-discovery from `research/` topic patterns
- Projects generate their own skill clusters
- Semantic search index (qmd) over all nodes
- See [[skill-graph-self-maintenance]]

**Open-Source bprd-core Preset** (target: Q3 2026)
- Package this graph as public arscontexta preset
- Other teams can bootstrap from BPR&D's operational patterns
