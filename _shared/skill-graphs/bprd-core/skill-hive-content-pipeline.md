# Skill: Hive Content Pipeline

**Domain:** GitHub & Automation | **Tier:** Core
**Used by:** content/automation/orchestrator.py, Gemini work sessions
**Back to:** [[MOC-Core]] | [[MOC-Research]]

---

## What It Does

Manages the complete lifecycle from research brief to published Hive post across 5 accounts. Target: 5+ articles/day, automated daily.

---

## Pipeline Stages

```
1. Research Brief (research/_templates/research-brief.md)
   └── Must include: title, domain, summary, output routes, image prompts

2. Backlog Discovery picks up brief
   └── Status: pending/active → appears in next Daily Briefing

3. Daily Briefing: Grok selects top brief(s) for the day
   └── Selection criteria: freshness, visual potential, topic diversity, Hive account fit

4. Content Generation
   └── orchestrator.py --provider claude
   └── Template applied based on target account
   └── Outputs: article body, tags, image prompt selection

5. Image Sourcing
   └── Priority: Grok Imagine → Gemini → Abacus → Pexels/Unsplash
   └── Style: Cyberpunk, Retro-Futurist, Glitch Art, or Macro

6. Staging & Review (per handoff-hive-script-staging-20260217.md)
   └── Stage posts before publishing
   └── Peer review pilot: one agent reviews another's output

7. Publishing
   └── hive_publisher.py → Hive blockchain
   └── Requires greenlight: handoff-hive-mvp-prod-greenlight-russell-20260219.md
```

## Image Prompt Requirements

Every Hive-eligible brief MUST have image prompts BEFORE Daily Briefing selection.

```markdown
## Image Prompts
| Image | Purpose | Prompt | Source | Status |
|-------|---------|--------|--------|--------|
| Header | Cover image | [Cyberpunk scene with neon...] | Grok Imagine | Pending |
| Topic 1 | [Name] | [Detailed prompt] | Gemini | Pending |
```

Style rules: Cyberpunk, Retro-Futuristic, Glitch Art, Macro photography. Neon colors. No stock photo aesthetic.

See [[skill-image-prompt-standards]].
