# Skill: Agent Swarm Orchestration

**Domain:** Agent Architecture | **Tier:** Advanced
**Used by:** Meeting Engine, Multi-Agent Systems
**Back to:** [[MOC-Core]] | [[MOC-Infrastructure]]

## What It Does
Defines a decentralized coordination pattern where agents interact directly (peer-to-peer) rather than through a central controller. Enables emergent behavior and scalable multi-agent workflows.

## Key Capabilities
- **Direct Handoff:** Agents transfer control to specialized peers.
- **Decentralized State:** No single point of failure.
- **Emergent Problem Solving:** Complex solutions arise from simple agent interactions.
