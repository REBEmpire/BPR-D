# Skill: Content Template System

**Domain:** Research Pipelines | **Tier:** Core
**Used by:** content/automation/orchestrator.py, Hive pipeline
**Back to:** [[MOC-Core]] | [[MOC-Research]]

---

## What It Does

Maps 5 Hive accounts to their content templates, defines tone/format requirements per account, and provides the orchestrator with the right template for each publishing target.

---

## Template × Account Map

| Account | Template | Tone | Word Count | Format |
|---------|----------|------|-----------|--------|
| @ddas-devblog | `dev-update` | Technical, practical, enthusiastic | 800-1200 | Tutorial-style with code snippets |
| @ddas-lore | `lore-story` | Narrative, immersive, mythological | 600-1000 | Story with world-building details |
| @ddas-strategy | `strategy-guide` | Analytical, tactical, actionable | 700-1100 | Numbered guides with examples |
| @ddas-community | `community-spotlight` | Warm, celebratory, inclusive | 500-800 | Feature-style with highlights |
| @ddas-news | `news-announcement` | Clear, punchy, factual | 400-600 | Inverted pyramid, key facts first |

---

## Template Structure (Example: dev-update)

```markdown
# [Title: What We Built]

[Opening hook — technical insight or problem statement]

## The Problem
[What we were trying to solve]

## The Approach
[How we thought about it]

## The Implementation
[Key technical details — code snippets welcome]

## What We Learned
[Insights, gotchas, surprises]

## What's Next
[Tease next steps — engagement hook]

## Orchestrator Usage

```python
# content/automation/orchestrator.py
python orchestrator.py \
    --provider claude \
    --account ddas-devblog \
    --brief research/briefs/2026-02-18-hive-pipeline.md \
    --template dev-update
```

The orchestrator:
1. Reads the research brief
2. Applies the template structure
3. Calls Claude API to generate the article
4. Applies Hive formatting (markdown, tags)
5. Outputs to `content/drafts/[date]-[account]-[title].md`

---

## Hive-Specific Formatting

```markdown
---hive-metadata---
account: @ddas-devblog
tags: [ai, development, ddas, open-source]
beneficiary: rebempire:10
---

# Title

[Content]

---
*[Footer]*
```
