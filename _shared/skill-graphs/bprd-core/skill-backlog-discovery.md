# Skill: Backlog Discovery & Ingestion

**Domain:** Backlog & Discovery | **Tier:** Core
**Used by:** crewai-service/backlog/discovery.py, Meeting Engine Phase 0
**Back to:** [[MOC-Core]] | [[MOC-Handoffs]]

---

## What It Does

Scans 6 source types across the repo, extracts open/pending work items, ranks by priority, and returns the top 5 as structured context for the session agent.

---

## Scan Sources (in order)

| Source | File Path | Parser |
|--------|-----------|--------|
| Living TODO | `_shared/handoff-living-to-do-list.md` | Checkbox extractor |
| Escalation handoffs | `_agents/_handoffs/*.md` | Status + field parser |
| Agent handoffs | `_agents/[agent]/handoff.md` | Table parser |
| Roadmap | `_agents/roadmap-2026.json` | JSON milestone parser |
| Team state | `_agents/team_state.md` | Checkbox extractor |
| Pre-launch checklist | `_agents/PRE-LAUNCH-CHECKLIST.md` | Checkbox extractor |

**NEW (skill graph integration):** Skill nodes referenced in handoffs are traversed to depth 3. See [[skill-wiki-link-traversal]].

---

## Priority Ranking

```python
PRIORITY_RANK = {
    "critical": 0,
    "urgent": 1,
    "high": 2,
    "medium": 3,
    "low": 4,
}
```

Items are sorted ascending (0 = highest priority) and top 5 are returned.

---

## Output Format

```markdown
## Open Backlog Items (23 total, showing top 5)

### 1. [Title]
- **Source**: `_agents/_handoffs/handoff-xxx.md`
- **Priority**: high
- **Status**: open
- **Assigned to**: Claude
- **Due**: 2026-02-19
- **Context**: [first 200 chars of Context section]
```

---

## Wiki Link Traversal (New)

When a backlog item's source file contains `[[wiki-link]]` references to skill nodes:
1. Discovery loads the linked skill node
2. Extracts "What It Does" and "Related Skills" sections
3. Appends as `## Linked Context` block to the item
4. Traverses up to **depth 3** (link → link → link, then stops)

This means a handoff referencing `[[skill-hive-content-pipeline]]` automatically pulls in the full pipeline context — without the agent needing to know to look for it.

See [[skill-wiki-link-traversal]] for implementation.

---

## Stats Line

Every session report includes:
```
Backlog items processed: 5 | Actions completed: 2 | Next items queued: 18
```
