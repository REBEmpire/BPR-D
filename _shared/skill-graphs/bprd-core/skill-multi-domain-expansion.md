# Skill: Multi-Domain Expansion (add-domain Pattern)

**Domain:** Navigation & Meta | **Tier:** Advanced
**Used by:** Russell + senior agents when expanding to new verticals
**Back to:** [[MOC-Core]]

---

## What It Does

Defines the `add-domain` pattern for integrating new project verticals (e.g., YouTube automation, Substack, new games) into the BPR&D skill graph without breaking the existing structure.

---

## When to Use

Trigger this pattern when:
- BPR&D launches a new product line or platform
- A research domain grows large enough to warrant its own skill cluster
- A new external integration needs operational documentation
- Russell says "we're doing [X] now" and X doesn't have nodes yet

---

## add-domain Steps

```
Step 1: Create MOC-[Domain].md
    ├── Follow MOC template (header, overview, skill nodes table, living sections)
    ├── Link back to [[MOC-Core]]
    └── Add to MOC-Core.md MOC Index table

Step 2: Create 3-5 seed skill nodes
    ├── One "overview" node (what this domain is, how it fits BPR&D)
    ├── One "pipeline" node (the core workflow for this domain)
    ├── One "output format" node (what outputs look like)
    └── Optional: "tools & integrations" node, "quality gates" node

Step 3: Add domain tags to prompt-injection-runtime
    ├── Edit DOMAIN_TAGS dict in [[skill-prompt-injection-runtime]]
    ├── Map domain keywords → relevant skill nodes
    └── Test: create a backlog item with domain keywords, verify injection

Step 4: Update backlog/discovery.py scan sources (if needed)
    ├── Add new source path if domain has its own file format
    └── Add parser if source uses non-standard format

Step 5: Announce in next Daily Briefing
    └── "New domain added: [Domain]. [N] skill nodes. Ready for work sessions."
```

## Example: Adding YouTube Automation

```
MOC-YouTube.md
├── skill-youtube-pipeline.md (research → script → upload → SEO)
├── skill-youtube-channel-config.md (3 planned channels, schedules)
├── skill-youtube-thumbnail-gen.md (Gemini image gen + template)
├── skill-youtube-analytics.md (what metrics matter)
└── skill-youtube-seo-standards.md (tags, description format)

Domain tags:
  "youtube": ["skill-youtube-pipeline", "skill-youtube-channel-config"]
  "video": ["skill-youtube-pipeline", "skill-youtube-thumbnail-gen"]
  "script": ["skill-youtube-pipeline"]
```

---

## Conventions

- New MOCs must link to `[[MOC-Core]]` in their first paragraph
- New skill nodes must have `Back to: [[MOC-Core]] | [[MOC-[Domain]]]`
- All new nodes use [[skill-yaml-frontmatter-standards]] headers
- Domain name is lowercase-hyphenated: `youtube`, `substack`, `slingerlands`
