# Skill: Handoff Escalation

**Domain:** Backlog & Discovery | **Tier:** Core
**Used by:** All agents, Meeting Engine Phase 4 (synthesis)
**Back to:** [[MOC-Core]] | [[MOC-Handoffs]]

---

## What It Does

Defines when and how to escalate from operational tasks (agent handoff.md tables) to formal escalation handoffs (`_agents/_handoffs/*.md`), and when to escalate further to HiC_Needed.

---

## Escalation Triggers

**Operational → Escalation Tier when:**
- Task requires more than 1 session to complete
- Task requires Russell's accounts, credentials, or direct decision
- Task blocks another task (URGENT)
- Task spans multiple agents
- Task involves budget > routine work session cost
- Task has significant failure risk if done wrong

**Escalation → HiC_Needed when:**
- Requires Russell's API keys, Render dashboard, GitHub OAuth
- Requires human judgment that can't be delegated
- Large batch processing beyond API budget
- Experimental work where quality matters more than cost

---

## Escalation Template

When creating an escalation handoff, copy from `_agents/_templates/handoff.md`:

```markdown
---
Date: YYYY-MM-DD
Author: [Creating Agent] | Model: [model-id]
Version: v1.0
Status: open

# Handoff: [Descriptive Title]

**Status**: open
**Priority**: [URGENT|High|Medium|Low]
**Assigned to**: [Agent or Russell]
**Due date**: YYYY-MM-DD
**Created by**: [Agent]

## Context
[Why this task exists, what triggered the escalation, relevant background]

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] [Specific measurable outcome 1]
- [ ] [Specific measurable outcome 2]
- [ ] [Specific measurable outcome 3]

## Dependencies
- [What must be done/available before this can proceed]

## Notes
[Any additional context, risks, or approach suggestions]
```

## Escalation Path

```
1. Agent-to-Agent → create row in target agent's handoff.md
2. Technical Block → escalate to Gemini (code) or Abacus (systems)
3. Strategic Question → escalate to Claude or Grok
4. Human Decision → create _handoffs/ template, tag for Russell
5. HiC_Needed → write HiC_Needed.md, wait for approval
```

Grok has final say on prioritization disputes.

## Anti-Patterns

**Don't escalate prematurely:** Not every task needs a formal handoff. If it's done in one session, it stays in the operational table.

**Don't under-escalate:** If something blocks the pipeline and needs Russell, create the escalation NOW. Don't wait for the next Daily Briefing to ask.

**Don't ghost escalations:** Once created, track it. Update status. If blocked, say so. If done, archive it.
