# Skill: Memory Types & Locations

**Domain:** Knowledge & Memory | **Tier:** Core
**Used by:** All agents — session start and end
**Back to:** [[MOC-Core]]

---

## What It Does

Maps the 4 memory types to their storage locations and access patterns. Every agent reads and writes to these locations as part of the [[skill-agent-cognition]] loop.

---

## Memory Type Map

| Type | Location | Purpose | Who Writes | Update Frequency |
|------|----------|---------|-----------|-----------------|
| **Episodic** | `_agents/_shared/memories/episodic/YYYY/MM/` | What happened in sessions | Any agent | Per significant session |
| **Semantic** | `_agents/_shared/memories/semantic/` | Domain knowledge learned | Senior agents | When new domain knowledge validated |
| **Procedural** | `_agents/_shared/memories/procedural/` | Techniques that work | Any agent | When technique proven |
| **Strategic** | `_agents/_shared/memories/strategic/` | Decisions and lessons | Claude/Grok | Human approval |

---

## Per-Agent Memory Files

Each agent also maintains their own personal memory:

```
_agents/[agent]/
├── context/active.md    ← Current state (updated every session)
├── memory.md            ← Personal diary/observations (updated every session)
├── handoff.md           ← Active task table
├── profile.md           ← Static persona (rarely changes)
└── learnings/           ← Procedural notes, domain knowledge
```

---

## What Goes Where

**Episodic** — "What happened": Meeting transcripts, key session events, decision moments
```
_agents/_shared/memories/episodic/2026/02/2026-02-18-skill-graph-launch.md
```

**Semantic** — "What we know": Domain knowledge that's been validated across multiple sessions
```
_agents/_shared/memories/semantic/hive-blockchain-patterns.md
```

**Procedural** — "How to do it": Techniques that work, with evidence
```
_agents/_shared/memories/procedural/2026-02-13-render-static-db-sync.md
```

**Strategic** — "What we decided": Architectural decisions, lessons learned with Russell's sign-off
```
_agents/_shared/memories/strategic/2026-02-ddas-architecture-decisions.md
```

---

## Skill Graph as Collective Memory

The `_shared/skill-graphs/bprd-core/` directory is itself a form of **procedural + semantic memory** — it encodes the operational patterns that have emerged from BPR&D's work, in a format that agents can traverse and inject at runtime.

This is the key evolution: individual agent memory files are updated per session, but the skill graph is the **organizational brain** that persists patterns across all agents.
