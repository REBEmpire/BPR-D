# Skill: YAML Frontmatter Standards

**Domain:** Knowledge & Memory | **Tier:** Core
**Used by:** All agents, all file types
**Back to:** [[MOC-Core]]

---

## What It Does

Defines the required YAML frontmatter block that EVERY agent-authored `.md` file must start with. No exceptions.

---

## Standard Block

```yaml
---
Date: YYYY-MM-DD
Author: [Agent Name] | Model: [model-id]
Version: v1.0
Status: Draft | Active | Review | Archived
---
```

### Field Rules

| Field | Rule |
|-------|------|
| `Date` | Date of LAST substantive edit (not creation date) |
| `Author` | Agent or human who last updated it. AI files: include model ID. |
| `Version` | Minor (v1.1) for content updates. Major (v2.0) for structural rewrites. |
| `Status` | Draft (WIP), Active (operational), Review (needs human approval), Archived (superseded) |

---

## Special Status Values

### Session Files (auto-generated by Meeting Engine)
Engine populates all four fields at generation time.

### HiC_Needed Files
Status values override generic vocabulary:
- `Pending` — awaiting Russell's review
- `Approved` — Russell approved, proceed
- `Denied` — Russell rejected, don't proceed

### Skill Nodes (this graph)
- All skill nodes: Status: Active
- Proposed nodes (pre-review): Status: Draft
- Superseded nodes: Status: Archived (not deleted — keep for history)

---

## Model IDs Reference

| Agent | Model |
|-------|-------|
| Grok | grok-beta (or current xAI model) |
| Claude | claude-sonnet-4-6 (or current Anthropic model) |
| Gemini | gemini-2.0-flash-exp (or current Google model) |
| Abacus | abacus-ai-model (or current Abacus model) |
| HiC Russell | human |

---

## Enforcement

The Meeting Engine's Phase 6 (post-processing) validates that all committed session files have correct frontmatter. Malformed files are flagged in the session cost block.
