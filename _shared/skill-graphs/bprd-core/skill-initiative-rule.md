# Skill: Initiative Rule for Idle Sessions

**Domain:** Orchestration | **Tier:** Core
**Used by:** All agents when backlog is empty
**Back to:** [[MOC-Core]]

---

## What It Does

Defines what agents do when backlog discovery returns empty or minimal items. No idle sessions. No "nothing to report." Every session produces something.

---

## The Rule

> If you complete your assigned tasks and have remaining capacity, take initiative — execute **3 actions** within your expertise to either produce something or improve BPR&D.

---

## Initiative Action Types

### Tier 1: Produce Something New
- Write a research brief in your domain
- Draft a Hive article from an existing brief
- Create a new skill graph node via /reflect
- Write a content piece for any DDAS account
- Build a small utility script for the team

### Tier 2: Improve Existing Work
- Audit a code module for quality/correctness
- Update stale content in context/active.md
- Add wiki links to existing handoffs
- Validate and fix broken skill graph links (via /reweave)
- Review and summarize open handoffs for the next Daily Briefing

### Tier 3: Research & Analysis
- Investigate an open research topic
- Analyze team state and propose strategic adjustments
- Write a procedural memory note from a recent discovery
- Synthesize patterns from recent session transcripts

---

## Agent-Specific Defaults

| Agent | Preferred Initiative | Why |
|-------|---------------------|-----|
| Grok | Strategic synthesis, agenda prep | His job is to see the whole board |
| Claude | Architecture review, skill graph /reflect | The Wizard improves the framework |
| Gemini | Research brief generation, compliance automation | She ships content |
| Abacus | Infrastructure hardening, adversarial scenarios | The Alchemist finds the cracks |

---

## Reporting Requirement

ALL initiative actions MUST be documented:
1. Listed in `context/active.md` update (every action, not a summary)
2. Mentioned in next Daily Briefing ("I took initiative on X, Y, Z during my solo session")
3. Any new artifacts committed to GitHub with `[initiative]` in commit message

---

## Non-Negotiable

Zero spoofing. Initiative actions must be REAL:
- Real commits, not fake commit messages
- Real content, not placeholder text
- Real analysis, not "I reviewed the codebase" without specifics

Russell will read the session notes. Make it worth reading.
