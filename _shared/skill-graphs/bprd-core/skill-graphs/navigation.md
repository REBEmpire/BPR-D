# Skill: Skill Graph Navigation (Meeting Engine Integration)

**Domain:** Navigation & Meta | **Tier:** Core
**Used by:** Meeting Engine Phase 0, every work_session prompt
**Back to:** [[MOC-Core]]

---

## What It Does

This is the **entry point skill** that the Meeting Engine loads at the start of every session. It provides agents with immediate orientation to the skill graph and tells them exactly how to use it during their session.

---

## Invocation Pattern

In every work_session prompt, the Meeting Engine appends:

```markdown
## Skill Graph Available

You have access to BPR&D's operational skill graph at:
`_shared/skill-graphs/bprd-core/`

**Navigation:**
- [[MOC-Core]] — Master index (start here for orientation)
- [[MOC-Handoffs]] — All handoff protocols and live handoff index
- [[MOC-Infrastructure]] — Deployment, scheduling, cost governance
- [[MOC-Research]] — Research pipelines and content output

**Your backlog items may reference [[wiki links]] to skill nodes.**
Follow those links for detailed procedural guidance.

**Initiative actions:** If backlog is complete, run /reflect to add a new skill node.
```

## Quick Reference Card

SKILL GRAPH QUICK REF:
• Handoff format     → [[skill-handoff-protocols]]
• Session output     → [[skill-session-output-format]]
• Quality gate       → [[skill-quality-filter]]
• Cost rules         → [[skill-cost-governance]]
• Image prompts      → [[skill-image-prompt-standards]]
• Idle session       → [[skill-initiative-rule]] → run /reflect
• New domain         → [[skill-multi-domain-expansion]]
• Self-evolution     → [[skill-agent-self-evolution]]

### Injected Prompt Block (for Meeting Engine reference)

## Implementation in Meeting Engine

```python
async def build_session_prompt(agent: str, backlog: BacklogResult, session_type: str) -> str:
    """Build the full session prompt with skill graph navigation."""

    # Load agent context
    agent_context = await read_file(f"_agents/{agent}/context/active.md")
    agent_handoff = await read_file(f"_agents/{agent}/handoff.md")

    # Load skill graph navigation skill
    nav_skill = await read_file("_shared/skill-graphs/bprd-core/skill-graphs/navigation.md")

    # Detect domains from backlog and inject relevant skills
    domains = detect_domains(backlog.top_items)
    injected_skills = await load_skill_context(domains)  # [[skill-prompt-injection-runtime]]

    # Build prompt
    prompt = f"""
{load_agent_system_prompt(agent)}

## Current Date
{today()}

## Your Context
{agent_context}

## Your Active Handoffs
{agent_handoff}

## Open Backlog
{backlog.to_context_string()}

## Skill Graph Navigation
{nav_skill_summary()}

## Relevant Skills (auto-loaded)
{injected_skills}

## Session Instructions
Session type: {session_type}
Follow [[skill-session-output-format]] for your output structure.
Follow [[skill-initiative-rule]] if backlog is empty.
"""
    return prompt
```

## Why This Skill Exists

Without a navigation entry point, agents in every new session would need to:
1. Know the skill graph exists
2. Know where to find it
3. Know which nodes are relevant
4. Know how to traverse wiki links

This skill collapses all four steps into a single auto-injected block. The graph becomes **ambient intelligence** rather than an opt-in reference library.

## Related Skills

- [[MOC-Core]] — master index this skill points to
- [[skill-prompt-injection-runtime]] — loads domain-specific skills after this navigation block
- [[skill-meeting-engine]] — calls this during Phase 0
- [[skill-backlog-discovery]] — provides the backlog this skill references
- [[skill-initiative-rule]] — triggered when backlog is empty (mentioned in prompt)
