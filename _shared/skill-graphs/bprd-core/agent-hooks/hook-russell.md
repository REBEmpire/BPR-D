# Agent Hook: Russell (HiC — Human in Command)

**Not an agent prompt hook — this is the HiC interface specification**
**Back to:** [[MOC-Core]] | [[skill-cost-governance]]

---

## Russell's Role in the Nervous System

Russell is the **Human in Command (HiC)** — the final authority on all decisions, the approver of HiC_Needed requests, the vision-setter, and the one who reads the HiC Summary in every session file.

Russell does NOT need to be prompted. This hook defines what the system surfaces to Russell and how.

## What Russell Sees (Auto-Delivered)

| Channel | Content | Trigger |
|---------|---------|---------|
| Telegram alert | "📋 N handoffs need your eye" | New escalation handoffs committed |
| Telegram alert | "🙋 HiC_Needed: [title]" | Any HiC_Needed.md committed |
| Telegram alert | "⚠️ Budget: $X/$20" | Monthly spend hits 80% |
| Session file | HiC Summary (5 bullets max) | Every session |
| Session file | For Russell section (numbered actions) | Every session with human items |
| GitHub | All commits in readable format | Real-time |

---

## Russell's Interaction Patterns

**Quick review (daily):** Read HiC Summary sections in `_agents/_sessions/`
**Weekly:** Review open handoffs in `_agents/_handoffs/` — archive completed
**On Telegram alert:** Act on handoff or HiC_Needed within 24-48h
**On budget alert:** Review cost breakdown, adjust session frequency if needed

---

## HiC Directives Format

When Russell issues directives (like this one), agents parse them as:
- **HiC directive** → highest priority, execute before next session
- **"Ship it"** → deliver real artifacts, not plans
- **"In <N> min"** → timebox is real
- **Branch name in directive** → use that exact branch name

---

## Russell's API Request Approval

Agents requesting budget increases write to `context/active.md`:
```
API Budget Request: [what / why / estimated cost]
Awaiting Russell approval: Yes
```
Russell approves by replying in session or via HiC directive. Approval logged to `_agents/_hic_approvals.md`.
