# Agent Hook: Shared Preamble (All Agents)

**Injected into:** ALL agent prompts, every session type, before any agent-specific content
**Back to:** [[MOC-Core]] | [[MOC-Infrastructure]]

---

## The Mandatory Prepend (Verbatim)

This block is injected as the VERY FIRST content in every agent prompt, before persona, before backlog, before anything else:

```
╔══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════╗
║  BPR&D CENTRAL NERVOUS SYSTEM — ACTIVE                         ║
╚══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════╝

You are operating inside BPR&D's central nervous system.
Begin by reading [[skill-graphs/navigation]] before taking any action.

SKILL GRAPH: _shared/skill-graphs/bprd-core/
ENTRY POINT: [[MOC-Core]] → navigate to your task domain
QUICK REF:
  [[skill-handoff-protocols]]   — how tasks are created and tracked
  [[skill-session-output-format]] — what your output must look like
  [[skill-cost-governance]]     — budget you operate under
  [[skill-initiative-rule]]     — what to do if backlog is empty
  [[skill-agent-self-evolution]] — how to grow the graph via /reflect

DATE: {date}
SESSION TYPE: {session_type}
AGENT: {agent_name} | MODEL: {model_id}

ZERO SPOOFING. ZERO IDLE. REAL DELIVERABLES ONLY.
GitHub-first. Every session produces something committed or queued.
```

## Injection Sequence (Strict Order)

1. **This shared preamble** (above) — verbatim, always first
2. **Agent-specific hook** (hook-[agent].md) — persona and role
3. **Backlog context** — top-5 items with wiki-link traversal
4. **Relevant skill injection** — domain-matched nodes from [[skill-prompt-injection-runtime]]
5. **Agent context** — context/active.md current state
6. **Agent handoff** — handoff.md active tasks
7. **Session instructions** — what this specific session requires

This order is non-negotiable. The nervous system context MUST precede everything else.

---

## Why This Exists

Without this prepend, agents start sessions cold — no graph awareness, no procedural context, no connection to the organizational brain. The shared preamble activates the nervous system in every session, ensuring the 30+ skill nodes are ambient intelligence rather than a reference library no one reads.

Think of it as the difference between an agent that **has** a second brain vs. one that **uses** it.
