# Skill: Skill Graph Self-Maintenance & Evolution

**Domain:** Navigation & Meta | **Tier:** Advanced
**Used by:** All agents (via /reflect), Meeting Engine /reweave
**Back to:** [[MOC-Core]]

---

## What It Does

Defines how the skill graph grows from 21 nodes to 500+ through automated discovery, agent /reflect cycles, and project expansion hooks.

---

## Auto-Discovery Sources

### From Research Topics
```python
# When a new research brief is committed:
# Auto-scan for concepts that don't have skill nodes yet
new_concepts = extract_concepts(brief_content)
for concept in new_concepts:
    if not skill_node_exists(concept):
        queue_for_agent_review(concept, domain=brief.domain)
```

### From Session Transcripts
After every Daily Briefing, scan transcript for:
- Novel problem-solving patterns
- Repeated references to concepts without skill nodes
- Agent-expressed confusion ("I'm not sure how to...") → knowledge gap

### From Handoff Patterns
When the same type of handoff is created 3+ times, auto-propose a skill node for that pattern.

---

## Link Validation

Run after every /reweave cycle:
```python
def validate_links(skill_graph_dir: str) -> list[str]:
    """Find broken [[wiki links]] across all skill nodes."""
    broken = []
    for node_file in glob(f"{skill_graph_dir}/*.md"):
        links = extract_wiki_links(node_file)
        for link in links:
            target = f"{skill_graph_dir}/{link}.md"
            if not exists(target):
                broken.append(f"{node_file} → [[{link}]] (missing)")
    return broken
```

Broken links are logged to `_debug/broken-links-YYYY-MM-DD.md` and filed as a Low priority backlog item.

---

## MOC Auto-Update

When a new skill node is committed, the relevant MOC is updated:
1. Detect domain from node's frontmatter and content
2. Find matching MOC (Core, Handoffs, Infrastructure, Research)
3. Add entry to the Skill Nodes section
4. Commit MOC update in same PR/commit

---

## Staleness Detection

Nodes not updated in 30 days are flagged:
```
Status: Active → needs review
```
Agent is notified in their next session to verify the node is still accurate.

---

## Scaling Architecture

| Scale | Strategy |
|-------|---------|
| 21 nodes (now) | Manual creation, wiki links |
| 50-100 nodes | Agent /reflect + auto-discovery from research |
| 100-250 nodes | Project clusters (each project gets mini-MOC) |
| 250-500 nodes | Domain expansion with add-domain pattern |
| 500+ nodes | Semantic search index (sentence-transformers + cosine similarity) |

---

## add-domain Pattern

When BPR&D expands into a new vertical (e.g., Substack, YouTube automation):
```
1. Create MOC-[Domain].md
2. Create 3-5 seed skill nodes for the domain
3. Add domain to prompt-injection-runtime domain tags
4. Link MOC to MOC-Core.md
5. Run /reweave to validate links
```

---

## Open-Source Preset (Q3 2026 Target)

The `bprd-core` graph will be packaged as a public arscontexta preset:
- License: MIT
- Target: Teams running multi-agent AI systems
- Value: Skip 6 months of operational pattern discovery
- Distribution: HuggingFace + GitHub
