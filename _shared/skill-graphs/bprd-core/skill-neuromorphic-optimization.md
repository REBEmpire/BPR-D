## What It Does
Optimizes AI agent logic to run on neuromorphic hardware (like Intel Loihi 3). It converts traditional matrix-based neural networks into "Spiking Neural Networks" (SNNs) that operate on an event-driven basis.

## Key Capabilities
- **Event-Driven Execution:** Agents only consume power when input data changes.
- **SNN Conversion:** Tools to transpile PyTorch/TensorFlow models to spiking equivalents.
- **Edge Deployment:** Enables complex inference on <20W power budgets.
