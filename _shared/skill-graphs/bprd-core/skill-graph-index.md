## Adding New Nodes

1. Create `skill-[name].md` in this directory
2. Add a row to the table above
3. Update the relevant MOC's Skill Nodes section
4. Update `## Graph Statistics` in [[MOC-Core]]
5. Add domain tags in [[skill-prompt-injection-runtime]] if applicable

Or run `/reflect` in your next work session and let the graph grow itself.
