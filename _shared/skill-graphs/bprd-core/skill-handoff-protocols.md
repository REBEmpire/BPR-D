# Skill: Handoff Protocols

**Domain:** Backlog & Discovery | **Tier:** Core
**Used by:** All agents, Meeting Engine Phase 6
**Back to:** [[MOC-Core]] | [[MOC-Handoffs]]

---

## What It Does

Defines the two-tier handoff system, creation rules, ownership, pruning cadence, and escalation path. Every agent must know this cold.

---

## Two-Tier System

### Tier 1 — Operational Tasks (`_agents/[agent]/handoff.md`)

Format:
```markdown
| Task | Assigned To | Priority | Status | Due |
|------|-------------|----------|--------|-----|
| Implement quality filter | Claude | High | In Progress | 2026-02-20 |
```

- Priority values: URGENT (blocking), High, Medium, Low
- Status values: Pending, In Progress, Blocked, Done
- Pruning: Remove "Done" rows after each session
- Updated by: Meeting Engine automatically + agents manually
- Visibility: Pulled to website TEAM page

### Tier 2 — Escalation (`_agents/_handoffs/*.md`)

For:
- Multi-session effort
- Russell-involved decisions (API keys, deployments, accounts)
- Cross-agent projects
- Ambitious agent-initiated work needing formal tracking

Naming: `handoff-[descriptive-name]-YYYYMMDD.md`
Template: `_agents/_templates/handoff.md`
Completed: Move to `_agents/_handoffs/archive/`

---

## Creation Rules

1. **Operational task** → add row to `_agents/[agent]/handoff.md`
2. **Escalation task** → copy template, fill context + acceptance criteria + deps
3. **Russell-needed** → also write `HiC_Needed.md`, see [[skill-cost-governance]]
4. **Any new handoff file** → auto-inject wiki link template (see [[skill-graph-self-maintenance]])

---

## Escalation Decision

```
Is it multi-session? → Tier 2
Does it need Russell's account/credentials? → Tier 2 + HiC_Needed
Does it block another task? → Tier 2, Priority: URGENT
Otherwise → Tier 1
```

---

## Ownership & Collaboration

- No hard limits on tasks per agent (trust agent judgment)
- Any agent can add tasks to any other agent's handoff (collaborative)
- If overwhelmed: push back → escalate to Grok → Grok decides
- Grok has final say on task prioritization
