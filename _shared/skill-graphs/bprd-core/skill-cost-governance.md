# Skill: Cost Governance

**Domain:** Infrastructure | **Tier:** Core
**Used by:** Meeting Engine, all agents, HiC Russell
**Back to:** [[MOC-Core]] | [[MOC-Infrastructure]]

---

## What It Does

Defines the two-pathway system for all BPR&D AI work: automated API calls (low friction, hard caps) vs. manual HiC work (high friction, unlimited quality). Prevents runaway spend while enabling ambitious work.

---

## Two Pathways

### Pathway 1: Automated API Work

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Team monthly budget | $20.00 |
| Per-meeting hard cap | $0.75 |
| Grok monthly allocation | $5.00 |
| Claude monthly allocation | $6.00 |
| Gemini monthly allocation | $5.00 |
| Abacus monthly allocation | $4.00 |

**Request process:** Add "API Budget Request" to `Context/active.md`. Russell approves in 24-48h.
**Cost tracking:** Actual token counts from API responses (not estimates).
**Soft alert:** At 80% monthly usage, log warning in next session file.

### Pathway 2: Manual HiC Work

For: Complex synthesis, large batch processing, experimental work, any task requiring Russell's account or judgment.

**Request process:**
1. Write `HiC_Needed.md` with: what / why / preferred-prompts
2. Russell reviews → Approved / Denied / Negotiated
3. Write to `_agents/_hic_approvals.md` (Russell maintains)

Template: `_agents/_hic_needed_template.md`

---

## When to Use Each Pathway

**Automated (Agent):**
- Daily research brief generation (Gemini)
- Meeting participation and synthesis (all agents)
- Code reviews and technical analysis (Claude, Gemini)
- Skill graph /reflect cycles (any agent)
- Routine handoff updates and session commits

**HiC_Needed (Manual):**
- "Synthesize all 9 research topics into launch narrative"
- "Build custom blockchain analysis tool"
- "2-hour multi-agent dialogue on media strategy"
- "Review and provide architectural feedback on entire DDAS system"
- Any task requiring Russell's GitHub/Render/API credentials

---

## Hard Cap Enforcement

```python
# In meetings/execute handler
if session_cost > MEETING_HARD_CAP:
    # Immediately terminate session generation
    # Log truncation in Session Cost block
    # Never bill more than cap regardless of actual usage
    raise MeetingCostCapExceeded(current_cost, MEETING_HARD_CAP)
```

Monthly enforcement: checked at session start. If monthly total is at cap, session is blocked and Russell is alerted.

---

## Philosophy

> "Cost governance forces intentionality: prioritize high-value work, delegate to agents when cost-effective, escalate complex work to Russell. Freedom WITH constraints, not freedom from constraints."
