# Skill: Agent Self-Evolution (/reflect & /reweave)

**Domain:** Agent Cognition | **Tier:** Advanced
**Used by:** Any agent during idle session capacity
**Back to:** [[MOC-Core]]

---

## What It Does

Enables agents to **grow the skill graph organically** from their actual work. When an agent discovers a pattern, solves a novel problem, or identifies a missing skill node, they can propose and commit new skill nodes — no human required.

---

## /reflect Command

Triggered when agent has completed assigned backlog items and has remaining session capacity.

```
/reflect
1. Review session transcript for novel patterns or discoveries
2. Check: does a skill node exist for this pattern?
3. If NO: draft a new skill node (atomic, linked, wiki-formatted)
4. If YES: propose updates/additions to the existing node
5. Output: new or updated .md file for commit
```

**Scope:** Agent's expertise domain only. Claude reflects on architecture and strategy. Gemini on automation and compliance. Grok on orchestration. Abacus on infrastructure and adversarial patterns.

---

## /reweave Command

Triggered during weekly retrospectives or when graph structure feels off.

```
/reweave
1. Scan all skill nodes for stale content (>30 days without update)
2. Identify broken or missing [[wiki links]]
3. Propose link additions or corrections
4. Update MOCs to reflect new nodes
5. Optionally: propose archiving obsolete nodes
```

---

## Evolution Rules

**Agents CAN:**
- Add new skill nodes within their domain
- Update "Related Skills" links in existing nodes
- Add "Living Sections" with future expansion ideas
- Propose domain tag additions for [[skill-prompt-injection-runtime]]

**Agents MUST get Russell approval for:**
- Removing or deprecating existing nodes
- Restructuring the MOC hierarchy
- Adding new top-level MOCs
- Changing the traversal algorithm in [[skill-wiki-link-traversal]]

**Format:** Every new node must use the standard template (see [[skill-yaml-frontmatter-standards]]) and include a "Related Skills" section with at least 2 links.

---

## Commit Protocol for New Nodes

```python
# Agent commits new skill node via GitHub API
path = f"_shared/skill-graphs/bprd-core/{node_name}.md"
message = f"[{agent_name}] /reflect: add skill node {node_name}"
# PR if structural change, direct commit if new leaf node
```

---

## Target Scale

| Milestone | Node Count | Timeline |
|-----------|-----------|----------|
| Initial | 21 | Feb 2026 |
| Phase 2 | 50+ | Mar 2026 |
| Phase 3 | 200+ | Q2 2026 |
| Full scale | 500+ | Q3 2026 |

Growth comes from: agent /reflect cycles + auto-discovery from `research/` topic patterns + new project domains.
