# BPR&D Agent Archive

These folders contain the original 6-agent configuration from BPR&D v1 (January 2026).

**Restructured:** February 2026

## What Changed

- **Jules** (Lead Developer) was merged into **Gemini** -- the merged persona is a coding savant who automates compliance
- **ChatLLM** (Utility Specialist) was merged into **Abacus** -- the merged persona combines Deep Agent's inventor mind with ChatLLM's trickster resourcefulness
- **Deep Agent** (Chief Innovator) was renamed to **Abacus** and absorbed ChatLLM's capabilities

## Why

Depth over breadth. Four agents with richer, more distinct personalities and clearer roles serve the team better than six agents with overlapping capabilities.
