# HiC Request: [Work Title]

## What I'm Doing

[Clear description of the work you want Russell to execute. What's the actual task? What will the output be?]

**Example:**
"I need Russell to synthesize all 9 research briefs into a cohesive narrative for the BPR&D launch announcement. This means integrating themes, identifying overlaps, finding the 'big story,' and producing a 500-word launch statement."

---

## What I Want to Accomplish

[What are the goals? What does success look like? Why does this matter to BPR&D?]

**Example:**
- Create a unified narrative that ties all research topics together
- Establish BPR&D's unique positioning in the AI + research space
- Produce marketing copy that Russell can use for launch
- Demonstrate that thematic coherence emerges from diverse research

---

## Preferred Prompt(s)

[Provide the exact prompt(s) Russell should use. Make them detailed, specific, and copy-paste ready. Don't make Russell guess what you want.]

**Example Prompt 1:**
```
I'm launching a research + AI collective called BPR&D (Broad Perspective Research & Development).
We've completed 18 research briefs across 9 topics:
1. Norse Mythology
2. Permaculture
3. History & Archaeology
4. Ancient Religions & Lost Civilizations
5. Extraterrestrial
6. High Tech
7. Corruption Investigation
8. Great Works & Writing
9. Open Lanes

Here are the briefs: [include list/links]

Create a 500-word launch statement that:
- Tells the story of WHY these 9 topics matter together
- Explains what BPR&D is doing differently
- Sounds visionary but credible
- Would make someone curious enough to explore our work
```

**Example Prompt 2:**
```
Given the themes above, what's the common thread?
What's the deeper insight that connects Norse mythology to corruption to AI to permaculture?
```

## Estimated Effort

[How long do you think this will take Russell? Is it a 30-min chat, 2-hour deep dive, or all-day project?]

**Example:**
- Time: 1-2 hours
- Complexity: High (synthesis requires understanding all 9 topics)
- Context needed: Access to all 18 research briefs
- Follow-up: May need 1-2 iteration rounds for refinement

---

## Rationale: Why Manual Work?

[Explain why this can't be automated or why Russell's judgment is essential.]

**Example:**
"This needs Russell's creative synthesis because:
1. It requires understanding marketing + research positioning (not a pure generation task)
2. The narrative needs to feel authentic to Russell's vision, not just academically correct
3. Launch messaging sets the tone for everything else—worth the time investment
4. Agents can brief, but Russell decides what story to tell"

---

## Russell's Response

**Status:** [Pending / Approved / Denied / Negotiated]

**Decision:** [Russell's written decision]

**If Approved:**
- Timeline: When will Russell do this?
- Approach: Will Russell use the preferred prompts as-is, or modify?
- Output format: Where will results go? How will they be shared?

**If Denied:**
- Reason: Why this doesn't fit the roadmap or isn't cost-effective
- Alternative: Is there an automated approach, or defer to later?

**If Negotiated:**
- What part will Russell do now?
- What part defers or gets automated?

## Notes
