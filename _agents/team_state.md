# Team State: Broad Perspective Research & Development

**Last Updated:** 2026-02-19 00:30 UTC (Claude Strategic Review)
**Current Session Focus:** 🚨 **API CRISIS CONTINGENCY PLANNING**

## 🚨 Critical Alerts
- 🔴 **API INFRASTRUCTURE CRISIS:** 50% failure rate blocking all automation
  - 4 critical Russell-assigned fixes overdue (Feb 17-18 deadlines)
  - Gemini 404 model mismatch, Abacus NoneType runtime errors
  - api_healer.py deployment pending (due Feb 18)
  - **Impact:** Meeting automation unreliable, agent work sessions degraded
- ⏸️ **Abacus:** On mission until Feb 23 (usage reset) - running 3-agent operations
- ❓ **Meeting Status:** First Automated Meeting (Feb 15) outcome unclear - no session logs found
- 💰 **Budget:** $20/month hard cap - API failures burning budget without deliverables

## 🎯 Active Projects

### 1. API Infrastructure Stabilization (Priority: CRITICAL - BLOCKED)
- **Goal:** Resolve 50% API failure rate to enable reliable automation
- **Lead:** Russell (human intervention required)
- **Status:** 🔴 **BLOCKED** - 4 critical fixes overdue
- **Blockers:**
  - Gemini model suffix mismatch (`-0214` vs base model name)
  - Abacus NoneType runtime errors
  - Dynamic model discovery not deployed
  - Guardian patterns not integrated
- **Downstream Impact:** ALL agent automation degraded until resolved
- **Next Steps:** Russell must deploy unified API Debug & Resilience Stack

### 2. Automated Meeting Infrastructure (Priority: CRITICAL - STATUS UNKNOWN)
- **Goal:** Daily/weekly automated team meetings via n8n workflows
- **Lead:** Russell (configured), Grok (facilitates), All agents (participate)
- **Status:** ❓ **UNCLEAR** - Feb 15 First Meeting outcome undocumented
- **Schedule:**
  - Daily: 07:47 AM (Morning Briefing), 11:49 AM (Midday Review), 12:33 PM (Grok Final Review)
  - Weekly: Monday 09:00 AM (Project Sync), Wednesday 10:00 AM (Income Review), Friday 03:00 PM (Retrospective)
- **Questions:**
  - Did Feb 15 meeting execute successfully?
  - Are meeting notes being committed to `_agents/_sessions/`?
  - Is website displaying meeting outputs?
- **Next Steps:** Audit meeting logs, assess reliability given API crisis

### 3. Research Programs (Priority: High - DEGRADED)
- **Goal:** Execute deep investigations into 9 key topic areas
- **Lead:** Gemini (Truth-Seekers - currently solo), Claude (Visionaries)
- **Status:** ⚠️ **DEGRADED** - API instability affecting brief generation
- **Output:** Daily research briefs visible on https://bpr-d.onrender.com/
- **Achievement:** 18 briefs shipped across all 9 topics (pre-crisis)
- **Next Steps:** Assess brief quality/consistency during API crisis period

### 4. DDAS Framework (Priority: Medium - PAUSED)
- **Goal:** Decentralized Digital Arts Studio - games, content automation, media production
- **Status:** Framework deployed, documentation complete, implementation PAUSED pending API stability
- **Components:**
  - Games: Splinterlands Civilization (4X), Slingerlands RPG (dungeon crawler)
  - Content: Python automation pipeline for 5 Hive accounts
  - Media: YouTube/podcast production infrastructure
- **Next Steps:** Resume after API crisis resolved

### 5. Media Production (Priority: Medium - PAUSED)
- **Goal:** Create gameified, entertaining content for BPR&D
- **Lead:** Grok (Oversight), Gemini (Tooling)
- **Status:** PAUSED - technology assessment blocked by API instability
- **Next Steps:** Resume after API crisis resolved

### 6. Web Presence (Priority: Medium - MONITORING)
- **Goal:** https://bpr-d.onrender.com/ displays all BPR&D outputs
- **Status:** ✅ LIVE - Shows research briefs, agent profiles, projects
- **Questions:** Are automated meeting notes appearing? Are briefs still updating?
- **Next Steps:** Audit website for gaps during API crisis period

## 👥 Team Roster (v2.0)

- **Grok:** Chief / Visionary / Executive
  - Model: grok-4-1-fast-reasoning
  - Status: ⚠️ DEGRADED - API instability affecting reliability
  - Recent Activity: Feb 17 session attempted meeting prep, unclear outcome

- **Claude:** Co-Second / Architect / Visionary
  - Model: claude-sonnet-4-5 (extended thinking enabled)
  - Status: ✅ OPERATIONAL - this session
  - Recent Activity: Feb 17 session focused on API crisis documentation
  - Current Role: Strategic contingency planning during infrastructure crisis

- **Gemini:** Lead Dev / Compliance / Truth-Seeker
  - Model: gemini-3-0-pro-preview
  - Status: ⚠️ DEGRADED - 404 model mismatch errors
  - Recent Output: 18 research briefs as Jules (pre-crisis)
  - Blocked Tasks: handoff_status_check.py deployment, DDAS MVP

- **Abacus:** Co-Second / Inventor / Truth-Seeker
  - Status: ⏸️ ON MISSION until Feb 23 (usage reset)
  - Role: Paused participation until return
  - Blocked Tasks: quintessence_router.py (requires stable healer logs)

## 🔑 Key Decisions Log
- **2026-01-29:** Team restructured from 6 agents to 4 (Jules -> Gemini, ChatLLM/Deep Agent -> Abacus)
- **2026-02-01:** Established 'Visionaries' vs 'Truth-Seekers' factions
- **2026-02-14:** Gemini API upgraded to paid tier - all 3 active agents operational
- **2026-02-14:** Automated meeting workflows configured - launching Feb 15
- **2026-02-17:** API crisis identified - 50% failure rate across Gemini/Abacus
- **2026-02-18:** Claude strategic review - contingency planning initiated

## 📊 Infrastructure Health Assessment (Feb 19)

**API Reliability:**
- Grok: Unknown (no recent error logs in sessions)
- Claude: ✅ Stable (this session operational)
- Gemini: 🔴 50% failure rate (404 model mismatch)
- Abacus: 🔴 NoneType runtime errors (paused anyway)

**Automation Status:**
- Work Sessions: ⚠️ Degraded but functional
- Meeting Engine: ❓ Status unclear (no Feb 15+ logs found)
- GitHub Commits: ✅ Operational (this session proves it)
- Website Updates: ❓ Needs audit

**Budget Impact:**
- $20/month hard cap
- 50% API failures = wasted spend on failed calls
- No deliverables during failed sessions = negative ROI
- **Urgency:** Fix required to stay within budget

## 🎯 Contingency Strategy (Claude's Recommendation)

**While APIs Are Unstable:**
1. **Focus on Design Work:** Architecture, frameworks, documentation
2. **Audit Existing Outputs:** Review 18 research briefs, assess quality
3. **Plan for Stability:** Prepare deployment checklists for when APIs recover
4. **Document Learnings:** What does this crisis teach us about infrastructure dependencies?
5. **Reduce API Calls:** Minimize automated sessions until stability confirmed

**When APIs Stabilize:**
1. Deploy api_healer.py immediately
2. Run comprehensive test suite across all agents
3. Resume automated meetings with monitoring
4. Deploy blocked agent tasks (handoff_status_check.py, DDAS MVP, etc.)
5. Conduct retrospective on crisis response

## 📝 Strategic Questions for Russell

1. **Meeting Status:** Did the Feb 15 First Automated Meeting execute? Where are the logs?
2. **API Timeline:** What's the realistic ETA for api_healer.py deployment?
3. **Failure Analysis:** Are the 50% failures consistent or intermittent?
4. **Budget Impact:** How much of the $20/month has been burned on failed API calls?
5. **Contingency Mode:** Should agents reduce automated session frequency until stability?

## 🎯 Success Criteria for Crisis Resolution

1. ✅ api_healer.py deployed with dynamic model discovery
2. ✅ Gemini 404 errors eliminated (model suffix fix)
3. ✅ Abacus NoneType errors resolved (or documented as pause-related)
4. ✅ 3 consecutive days of <10% API failure rate
5. ✅ All blocked agent tasks unblocked and deployed
6. ✅ Meeting automation reliability confirmed
7. ✅ Budget burn rate returns to sustainable levels

---

**Claude's Assessment:** This is an infrastructure crisis, not an agent capability crisis. The team has proven it can deliver (18 research briefs, meeting framework, DDAS design). But we're blocked by API instability that only Russell can fix. My recommendation: shift to low-API-call design work until stability is confirmed, then resume full automation.
