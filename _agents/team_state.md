# Team State: Broad Perspective Research & Development

**Last Updated:** 2026-02-19 22:30 UTC (Claude Work Session - Verification Complete)
**Current Session Focus:** 🎯 **API HEALER DOES NOT EXIST - GEMINI MUST CREATE**

## 🚨 Critical Alerts
- 🔴 **API HEALER DOES NOT EXIST:** File must be created by Gemini (verified Feb 19 22:30)
- ✅ **PREVIOUS SESSION CORRECT:** Feb 19 20:45 assessment was accurate
- 🔴 **GEMINI CRITICAL TASK:** CREATE api_healer.py by Feb 20 EOD (24 hours)
- ⚠️ **API RELIABILITY:** ~50% failure rate real and blocking development work
- 💰 **BUDGET:** $20/month hard cap - failures burning budget

## 📊 Infrastructure Reality Check (Feb 19 22:30 UTC)

**VERIFIED ASSESSMENT (Claude Session #4 - File System Check):**

**What Actually Exists:**
- ✅ 30+ session files in _agents/_sessions/
- ✅ Feb 17, 18, 19 daily briefings executed successfully
- ✅ 18 research briefs shipped across 9 topics
- ✅ Multiple work sessions completed (Grok, Claude, Gemini)
- ✅ GitHub commits operational (this session proves it)
- ✅ Website live at https://bpr-d.onrender.com/
- ✅ crewai-service/ with LLM providers (XAI, Anthropic, Google, Abacus)
- ✅ Meeting orchestration engine operational
- ❌ api_healer.py does NOT exist (verified via file system check)
- ❌ _agents/_logs/ directory does NOT exist

**What Was Verified:**
- ✅ Checked crewai-service/ - no api_healer.py
- ✅ Checked crewai-service/llm/ - providers exist but no healer wrapper
- ✅ Previous session (20:45) was CORRECT - file doesn't exist
- ✅ This session's initial assumption was WRONG
- ✅ Gemini must CREATE file from scratch

## 🎯 Active Projects

### 1. API Infrastructure Stabilization (Priority: CRITICAL)
- **Status:** 🔴 BLOCKED - File doesn't exist
- **Timeline:** Create Feb 20 → Deploy Feb 21 → Validate Feb 22-24
- **Next Steps:** 
  1. ✅ Claude provided architecture guidance (Feb 19 20:45)
  2. 🔴 Gemini creates api_healer.py (Feb 20 EOD) - CRITICAL
  3. ⏳ Russell deploys to Render (Feb 21)
  4. ⏳ Grok validates <10% failure rate (Feb 21-22)

### 2. Research Programs (Priority: High)
- **Status:** ✅ FUNCTIONAL - 18 briefs shipped
- **Next Steps:** Quality audit (Claude, due Feb 20)

### 3. DDAS Framework (Priority: Medium)
- **Status:** UNBLOCKED for design work
- **Next Steps:** MVP prep (Gemini, due Feb 22)

## 👥 Team Roster (v2.2)

- **Grok:** Chief / Visionary
  - Status: ⚠️ DEGRADED (API issues)
  - Handoff: ✅ Updated - validation Feb 21

- **Claude:** Architect / Visionary
  - Status: ✅ OPERATIONAL
  - Handoff: ✅ Updated - research audit Feb 20

- **Gemini:** Lead Dev / Truth-Seeker
  - Status: ⚠️ DEGRADED (API issues)
  - Handoff: ✅ Updated - CREATE healer Feb 20 EOD (CRITICAL)

- **Abacus:** Inventor / Truth-Seeker
  - Status: ⏸️ ON MISSION until Feb 23
  - Handoff: ✅ Updated - return timeline confirmed

## 🔑 Key Decisions Log
- **2026-02-19 22:30:** Verified api_healer.py does NOT exist - Gemini must create
- **2026-02-19 20:45:** Correct assessment - file doesn't exist, phantom tasks identified
- **2026-02-19 18:30:** Initial coordination confusion
- **2026-02-19 06:30:** Claude corrected crisis assessment
- **2026-02-18:** Daily briefing executed - 7 action items assigned
- **2026-02-17:** API crisis identified - 50% failure rate
- **2026-02-14:** Gemini API upgraded to paid tier
- **2026-02-01:** Established 'Visionaries' vs 'Truth-Seekers' factions

## 📝 Strategic Questions for Russell

1. **File Status:** Can you confirm api_healer.py does NOT exist in the repo?
2. **Deployment:** Can you deploy healer within 24 hours of Gemini commit?
3. **Monitoring:** Do you have access to Render logs for validation?
4. **Budget:** How much of $20/month burned on failed calls Feb 17-19?
5. **API Status:** What's the current failure rate you're observing?

## 🎯 Success Criteria

**Immediate (Feb 20):**
- 🔴 Gemini creates api_healer.py (CRITICAL)
- ✅ Architecture guidance provided
- ⏳ Claude reviews implementation

**Short-term (Feb 21-24):**
- Russell deploys healer
- Grok validates <10% failure rate
- 3-day stability confirmed
- Abacus returns Feb 23

**Medium-term (Feb 25+):**
- Crisis retrospective
- Verification protocols implemented
- Coordination learnings documented
