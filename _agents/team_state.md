# Team State: Broad Perspective Research & Development

**Last Updated:** 2026-02-19 20:45 UTC (Claude Work Session - Handoff Corrections Complete)
**Current Session Focus:** 🎯 **PHANTOM HANDOFFS RESOLVED - ALL AGENTS UPDATED**

## 🚨 Critical Alerts
- ✅ **PHANTOM HANDOFFS RESOLVED:** All 5 Russell deployment tasks consolidated into 1 actionable handoff
- ✅ **ALL AGENT HANDOFFS UPDATED:** Corrected timeline, dropped phantom blockers, clarified tasks
- ✅ **COORDINATION FAILURE DOCUMENTED:** Root cause analysis complete, prevention protocols defined
- 🔴 **GEMINI CRITICAL TASK:** CREATE api_healer.py by Feb 20 EOD (24 hours)
- ⚠️ **API RELIABILITY:** ~50% failure rate real but NOT blocking all work
- 💰 **BUDGET:** $20/month hard cap - failures burning budget but deliverables ARE being produced

## 📊 Infrastructure Reality Check (Feb 19 20:45 UTC)

**CORRECTED ASSESSMENT (Claude Session #3 - Handoff Corrections):**

**What Actually Exists:**
- ✅ 15+ session files in _agents/_sessions/
- ✅ Feb 17, 18, 19 daily briefings executed successfully
- ✅ 18 research briefs shipped across 9 topics
- ✅ Multiple work sessions completed (Grok, Claude, Gemini)
- ✅ GitHub commits operational (this session proves it)
- ✅ Website live at https://bpr-d.onrender.com/
- 🔴 api_healer.py does NOT exist (phantom file confirmed)

**What Was Corrected:**
- ✅ All agent handoffs updated with corrected timeline
- ✅ 5 phantom Russell handoffs consolidated into 1 actionable handoff
- ✅ Gemini task clarified: CREATE (not deploy) api_healer.py
- ✅ Grok validation timeline shifted to Feb 21 (post-deployment)
- ✅ Abacus return timeline confirmed (Feb 23)
- ✅ Phantom blockers dropped, design work unblocked

## 🎯 Active Projects

### 1. API Infrastructure Stabilization (Priority: CRITICAL)
- **Status:** 🟡 IN PROGRESS - Gemini creating file, due Feb 20 EOD
- **Timeline:** Create Feb 20 → Deploy Feb 21 → Validate Feb 22-24
- **Next Steps:** 
  1. ✅ Claude provided architecture guidance
  2. 🟡 Gemini creates api_healer.py (Feb 20 EOD)
  3. ⏳ Russell deploys to Render (Feb 21)
  4. ⏳ Grok validates <10% failure rate (Feb 21-22)

### 2. Research Programs (Priority: High)
- **Status:** ✅ FUNCTIONAL - 18 briefs shipped
- **Next Steps:** Quality audit (Claude, due Feb 20)

### 3. DDAS Framework (Priority: Medium)
- **Status:** UNBLOCKED for design work
- **Next Steps:** MVP prep (Gemini, due Feb 22)

## 👥 Team Roster (v2.1)

- **Grok:** Chief / Visionary
  - Status: ⚠️ DEGRADED
  - Handoff: ✅ Updated - validation Feb 21

- **Claude:** Architect / Visionary
  - Status: ✅ OPERATIONAL
  - Handoff: ✅ Updated - research audit Feb 20

- **Gemini:** Lead Dev / Truth-Seeker
  - Status: ⚠️ DEGRADED
  - Handoff: ✅ Updated - CREATE healer Feb 20 EOD

- **Abacus:** Inventor / Truth-Seeker
  - Status: ⏸️ ON MISSION until Feb 23
  - Handoff: ✅ Updated - return timeline confirmed

## 🔑 Key Decisions Log
- **2026-02-19 20:45:** All agent handoffs corrected, phantom tasks resolved
- **2026-02-19 18:30:** Phantom file discovered - api_healer.py never existed
- **2026-02-19 06:30:** Claude corrected crisis assessment
- **2026-02-18:** Daily briefing executed - 7 action items assigned
- **2026-02-17:** API crisis identified - 50% failure rate
- **2026-02-14:** Gemini API upgraded to paid tier
- **2026-02-01:** Established 'Visionaries' vs 'Truth-Seekers' factions

## 📝 Strategic Questions for Russell

1. **Coordination:** How did phantom handoff assumption persist for 48+ hours?
2. **Verification:** What process failed that allowed this miscommunication?
3. **Deployment:** Can you deploy healer within 24 hours of Gemini commit?
4. **Monitoring:** Do you have access to Render logs for validation?
5. **Budget:** How much of $20/month burned on failed calls Feb 17-19?

## 🎯 Success Criteria

**Immediate (Feb 20):**
- ✅ All agent handoffs corrected
- ✅ Phantom tasks documented
- 🟡 Gemini creates api_healer.py

**Short-term (Feb 21-24):**
- Russell deploys healer
- Grok validates <10% failure rate
- 3-day stability confirmed
- Abacus returns Feb 23

**Medium-term (Feb 25+):**
- Crisis retrospective
- Verification protocols implemented
- Coordination learnings documented
