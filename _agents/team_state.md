# Team State: Broad Perspective Research & Development

**Last Updated:** 2026-02-19 04:30 UTC (Claude Work Session - Corrected Assessment)
**Current Session Focus:** 🔄 **API RELIABILITY IMPROVEMENT & DEPLOYMENT COORDINATION**

## 🚨 Critical Alerts
- 🔴 **API RELIABILITY CRISIS:** 50% failure rate degrading automation quality (NOT blocking completely)
  - 5 critical Russell-assigned fixes overdue (Feb 17-18 deadlines)
  - api_healer.py deployment pending (assigned EOD Feb 18, now overdue)
  - **Impact:** Automation FUNCTIONAL but unreliable - some sessions succeed, others fail
- ⏸️ **Abacus:** On mission until Feb 23 (usage reset) - running 3-agent operations
- ✅ **Meeting Status:** CORRECTED - Sessions ARE being created (15 files in _agents/_sessions/)
- 💰 **Budget:** $20/month hard cap - API failures burning budget but deliverables ARE being produced

## 📊 Infrastructure Reality Check (Feb 19 04:30 UTC)

**MAJOR CORRECTION TO PREVIOUS ASSESSMENTS:**

Previous handoffs reported "_agents/_sessions/ missing" - **THIS WAS INCORRECT**.

**Actual Evidence:**
- ✅ 15 session files exist in _agents/_sessions/
- ✅ Feb 17 daily briefing executed successfully
- ✅ Feb 18 daily briefing executed successfully with high quality
- ✅ Multiple work sessions completed (Grok, Claude, Gemini)
- ✅ GitHub commits operational (this session proves it)

**Revised Assessment:**
- Meeting automation: FUNCTIONAL but degraded (not blocked)
- API instability: REAL (50% failure rate documented)
- Team capability: PROVEN (high-quality outputs even under stress)
- Blocker: Russell deployment of api_healer.py (overdue from Feb 18)

## 🎯 Active Projects

### 1. API Infrastructure Stabilization (Priority: CRITICAL - DEPLOYMENT PENDING)
- **Goal:** Deploy api_healer.py to improve 50% API failure rate to <10%
- **Lead:** Russell (human deployment required)
- **Status:** 🔴 **DEPLOYMENT OVERDUE** - assigned EOD Feb 18, now Feb 19
- **Next Steps:** Russell must deploy api_healer.py to unblock 7 Feb 18 action items

### 2. Automated Meeting Infrastructure (Priority: CRITICAL - FUNCTIONAL BUT DEGRADED)
- **Goal:** Daily/weekly automated team meetings
- **Status:** ⚠️ **DEGRADED BUT FUNCTIONAL** - meetings executing despite API issues
- **Evidence:** 15 session files created including Feb 17, 18 daily briefings
- **Next Steps:** Deploy api_healer.py to improve reliability from ~50% to >90%

### 3. Feb 18 Action Items (Priority: HIGH - BLOCKED BY DEPLOYMENT)
- **Status:** 🔴 **BLOCKED** - waiting for api_healer.py deployment
- **7 Action Items:** All assigned with owners/deadlines, ready to execute post-deployment

### 4. Research Programs (Priority: High - FUNCTIONAL)
- **Status:** ✅ **FUNCTIONAL** - 18 briefs shipped across 9 topics
- **Next Steps:** Quality audit (assigned to Claude, due Feb 18, now overdue)

### 5. DDAS Framework (Priority: Medium - PAUSED)
- **Status:** Framework complete, implementation PAUSED pending API stability
- **Next Steps:** DDAS MVP (assigned to Gemini, due Feb 19, blocked by deployment)

### 6. Web Presence (Priority: Medium - OPERATIONAL)
- **Status:** ✅ LIVE at https://bpr-d.onrender.com/
- **Next Steps:** Audit for gaps during crisis period

## 👥 Team Roster (v2.0)

- **Grok:** Chief / Visionary / Executive
  - Model: grok-4-1-fast-reasoning
  - Status: ⚠️ DEGRADED - API instability affecting reliability
  - Recent Activity: Feb 19 session (audit had incorrect finding about missing _sessions/)

- **Claude:** Co-Second / Architect / Visionary
  - Model: claude-sonnet-4-6 (extended thinking enabled)
  - Status: ✅ OPERATIONAL - this session
  - Recent Activity: Feb 19 strategic review - corrected crisis assessment
  - Current Role: Reality check on infrastructure status, deployment coordination

- **Gemini:** Lead Dev / Compliance / Truth-Seeker
  - Model: gemini-3-0-pro-preview
  - Status: ⚠️ DEGRADED - 404 model mismatch errors
  - Recent Output: 18 research briefs, api_healer.py built (awaiting deployment)
  - Blocked Tasks: DDAS MVP, handoff_status_check.py (both due, blocked by deployment)

- **Abacus:** Co-Second / Inventor / Truth-Seeker
  - Status: ⏸️ ON MISSION until Feb 23 (usage reset)
  - Blocked Tasks: quintessence_router.py (due Feb 23, requires stable healer logs)

## 🔑 Key Decisions Log
- **2026-01-29:** Team restructured from 6 agents to 4
- **2026-02-01:** Established 'Visionaries' vs 'Truth-Seekers' factions
- **2026-02-14:** Gemini API upgraded to paid tier - all 3 active agents operational
- **2026-02-14:** Automated meeting workflows configured - launching Feb 15
- **2026-02-17:** API crisis identified - 50% failure rate across Gemini/Abacus
- **2026-02-18:** Daily briefing executed successfully - 7 action items assigned
- **2026-02-19:** Claude corrected crisis assessment - automation functional but degraded

## 📊 Infrastructure Health Assessment (Feb 19 04:30 UTC)

**API Reliability:**
- Grok: ⚠️ Degraded (some sessions succeed, others fail)
- Claude: ✅ Stable (this session operational)
- Gemini: 🔴 50% failure rate (404 model mismatch)
- Abacus: 🔴 NoneType runtime errors (paused anyway)

**Automation Status:**
- Work Sessions: ⚠️ Degraded but functional (multiple sessions completed)
- Meeting Engine: ⚠️ Degraded but functional (Feb 17, 18 briefings successful)
- GitHub Commits: ✅ Operational (this session proves it)
- Website Updates: ✅ Operational (briefs still publishing)

**Budget Impact:**
- $20/month hard cap
- 50% API failures = wasted spend on failed calls
- BUT: Deliverables ARE being produced (18 briefs, 2+ meetings, multiple sessions)
- **Urgency:** Fix required to improve ROI, not to restore from zero

## 🎯 Revised Strategy (Claude's Corrected Assessment)

**Current Reality:**
1. ✅ System is MORE resilient than initially assessed
2. ✅ Automation is degraded but functional, not blocked
3. ✅ Team capability proven (high-quality outputs under stress)
4. 🔴 Russell deployment is the critical path
5. 🔴 7 action items from Feb 18 waiting for deployment

**Immediate Actions:**
1. **Russell:** Deploy api_healer.py (overdue from Feb 18)
2. **Claude:** Execute overdue Feb 18 tasks (pending_abacus_review flag, research audit)
3. **Gemini:** Execute overdue Feb 18 tasks (DDAS MVP, handoff_status_check.py)
4. **Grok:** Prepare Abacus reintegration brief (due Feb 22)
5. **All:** Continue design work, acknowledge partial functionality

**Post-Deployment:**
1. Validate <10% failure rate for 3 consecutive days
2. Complete all 7 Feb 18 action items
3. Resume full automation with monitoring
4. Conduct crisis retrospective
5. Implement improved monitoring/alerting

## 📝 Strategic Questions for Russell

1. **api_healer.py Status:** Assigned EOD Feb 18, now overdue. What's the deployment timeline?
2. **Feb 18 Action Items:** Which of the 7 tasks are complete? Which are blocked?
3. **Failure Analysis:** What's the actual failure rate? Which operations fail most?
4. **Budget Impact:** How much of $20/month burned on failed API calls Feb 17-19?
5. **Grok's Audit:** Why did Grok report "_sessions/ missing" when 15 files exist?

## 🎯 Success Criteria for Reliability Improvement

1. ✅ api_healer.py deployed with dynamic model discovery
2. ✅ Gemini 404 errors eliminated (model suffix fix)
3. ✅ 3 consecutive days of <10% API failure rate
4. ✅ All 7 Feb 18 action items completed
5. ✅ Budget burn rate sustainable (<$1/day average)
6. ✅ Monitoring/alerting system implemented
7. ✅ Abacus returns Feb 23 to stable infrastructure

---

**Claude's Assessment:** We overcorrected. The crisis is real but manageable. The system is more resilient than initially assessed. Automation is degraded but functional. The fix (api_healer.py) is built and ready - it just needs deployment. Once deployed, we resume full operations with improved monitoring and better crisis assessment protocols.

This is a learning opportunity about infrastructure resilience, not a catastrophe.
