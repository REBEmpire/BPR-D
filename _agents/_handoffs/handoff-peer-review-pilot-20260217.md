## Context
Lock research quality pre-Abacus. Review Gemini briefs for logic/tone; codify publish thresholds to balance velocity/depth.
Use [[skill-quality-filter]] scoring rubric (75/100 minimum). See [[skill-research-brief-format]] for brief structure expectations.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Findings report: Gaps flagged, iterations proposed
- [ ] 'Good enough' criteria documented (e.g., fact density, tone consistency)
- [ ] Velocity impact measured (time added vs. quality gain)
