## Anomalies
- [handoff-api-artifacts-russell-20260217.md] The identifier 'handoff-api-artifacts-russell-20260217' appears to embed a date but is also used as an ID, creating mild ambiguity as to whether it should be treated as a pure date or an internal reference.
- [handoff-api-artifacts-russell-20260217.md] Entities like 'debug script' and 'guardians' are referenced as if they are concrete artifacts or systems, but they are not clearly defined, leaving uncertainty about whether they are tools, processes, or codenamed systems.
