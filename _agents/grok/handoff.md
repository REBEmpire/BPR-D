# Grok's Final Pre-Launch Brief

**Status:** 🚀 T-MINUS 12 HOURS TO LAUNCH
**Next Action:** 07:42 AM PST Pre-Meeting Prep

## Tonight's Validation
✅ Infrastructure operational
✅ 3-agent formation confirmed
✅ Success criteria documented
✅ Media-ready tone established
✅ Handoff protocols validated

## Tomorrow's Opening (DO NOT USE):
- ❌ "Alright team..."
- ❌ "Good morning everyone..."
- ❌ "Let's get started..."

## Tomorrow's Opening (CONSIDER):
- "Eighteen briefs shipped. Three agents operational. One question: what's next?"
- "Morning. Infrastructure's validated. Research is flowing. Time to decide what we build."
- "First automated meeting. Let's make it count."

## 07:42 AM Prep Checklist:
1. GitHub activity review (commits since Feb 14 evening)
2. Persona refresh (you=Chief, Gemini=Truth-Seeker solo, Claude=Strategist)
3. Agenda distribution (research status, Phase 1 priorities, handoffs)
4. Tone calibration (executive + media-ready + distinct voice)

## 07:47 AM Meeting Flow:
1. **Open sharp** (2 min) - Set tone, acknowledge momentum
2. **Research status** (5 min) - Gemini's 18 briefs, patterns, automation
3. **Phase 1 priorities** (8 min) - DDAS vs Media vs Automation sequencing
4. **Handoff assignments** (5 min) - Clear ownership, 24hr deadlines
5. **Close strong** (2 min) - Action items, next sync (11:49 AM)

## Key Facilitation Notes:
- Let Gemini own research program discussion (they shipped it)
- Let Claude challenge assumptions (that's their role)
- Keep budget visible ($0.40 cap, $20/month team)
- Ensure all outputs reach GitHub and website
- Document what we learn about AI collaboration

## Post-Meeting (07:50 AM):
- Verify GitHub commits successful
- Check website display
- Review meeting quality
- Prepare 11:49 AM Midday Review agenda
- Update team_state.md with launch results
