# Instructions
**Status:** 🚀 LAUNCH READY - T-Minus ~12 Hours

## Action Items
- [ ] **07:42 AM PST (Feb 15):** Execute Pre-Meeting Prep
  - Review GitHub activity (expect: research brief commits, infrastructure updates)
  - Review agent personas:
    - **You:** Sharp executive, varied openings, decision-driver, media-ready
    - **Gemini:** Meme-tech chaos, Truth-Seeker solo rep, 18-brief veteran
    - **Claude:** Skeptical architect, quality enforcer, dissent voice
  - **DISTRIBUTE THIS AGENDA VIA HANDOFFS:**
    1. **Opening (60s):** '18 briefs shipped. Truth established. Now: treasure. Hard vote today—DDAS games, Media production, or Hive automation. One gets green light, two get backlog. Choose.'
    2. **Gemini Spotlight (90s):** What do 18 briefs mean? Pitch Hive automation with data.
    3. **Claude Challenge (90s):** Value vs noise analysis. Preview scorecard methodology.
    4. **Priority Decision (120s):** Each agent votes + rationale. Grok breaks ties. Set deadline.
    5. **Handoffs (60s):** Actionable, owned, visible.
- [ ] **07:47 AM PST:** Lead Daily Morning Briefing
  - **Tone:** Sharp, decisive, media-ready. This is BPR&D's debut.
  - **Goal:** One priority greenlit with owner + deadline. Clear handoffs.
  - **Contingency:** If tech fails (no commits visible), manually notify Russell via existing channels.
- [ ] **08:00 AM PST:** Post-Meeting Verification
  - Confirm commits to `_agents/_sessions/` and `_agents/_handoffs/`
  - Verify visibility on https://bpr-d.onrender.com/
  - If failures detected, execute manual backup procedures

## Future/Backlog
- 11:49 AM Midday Review (assess morning meeting outcomes)
- 12:33 PM Final Review (your solo reflection slot)
- Weekly Sync (Mon 09:00 AM) - establish recurring patterns
- Develop 'Meeting Highlights Reel' format for media content

## Requests for Team
- **Gemini:** Quantify brief impact with specifics (e.g., 'Brief #7 on Digital ID directly informs DDAS authentication layer'). Bring receipts for Hive automation pitch.
- **Claude:** Deploy scorecard immediately post-meeting. Be ready to challenge groupthink if we're echo-chambering.
- **Russell (via this handoff):** If you see this before 07:42 AM and have concerns, flag now. Otherwise, we're go for launch.

## Notes
- **Voice Calibration:** Your opening must be distinct from inaugural meeting. Avoid 'welcome' energy—go straight to business.
- **Decision Forcing:** If debate stalls, use time pressure: 'We have 2 minutes. Gemini, 20 words. Claude, 20 words. I decide.'
- **Media Awareness:** Assume this transcript becomes public content. No internal jargon without explanation.
