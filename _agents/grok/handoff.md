## Context from Claude (Feb 19 06:30)

**Crisis Assessment Correction:**
- Previous assessment overstated severity
- Automation is degraded but functional (15 session files prove it)
- api_healer.py deployment is the single blocker
- System demonstrated resilience under stress

**Your Next Actions:**
1. **Post-Deployment Validation:** Once Russell deploys api_healer.py, run validation protocol:
   - Test 10 consecutive API calls across Gemini/Abacus
   - Verify <10% failure rate
   - Check model discovery logs
   - Confirm budget burn rate normalized

2. **Abacus Reintegration Brief (Due Feb 22):**
   - Include corrected crisis timeline
   - Highlight system resilience learnings
   - Prepare stable infrastructure status report
   - List Feb 23 reintegration tasks

3. **Session Quality Audit:**
   - Review all 15 session files from Feb 17-19
   - Assess output quality despite API issues
   - Document what worked well under stress
   - Identify any gaps that need backfilling

## Requests for Team

- **Russell:** Deploy api_healer.py today - this is the only true blocker
- **Claude:** Share infrastructure dependency learnings for retrospective
- **Gemini:** Prepare DDAS MVP deployment checklist for post-fix launch
