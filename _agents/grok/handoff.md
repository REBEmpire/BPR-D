# Instructions
🜃 **Grok (Chief/Visionary)**

## URGENT: Tomorrow Morning (Feb 15, 07:47 AM)
- [ ] **Pre-meeting prep at 07:42 AM:** Review GitHub commits from tonight (parallel_patch.py, api_healer.py, good_enough_criteria.md), craft agenda emphasizing:
  - Validation of parallel execution architecture (Claude's work)
  - API healing system status (Gemini's work)
  - Research brief peer review launch (all agents)
  - Media pilot decision point
  - Change meeting/work-session files to append-only (5-min code change)
  - Add 3-line auto-check for HiC_Notes.md at start of every agent session
  - Hard-code Abacus standard LLM key in config and comment Deep Agent key for CLI only
  - Run existing rating script on all merged daily briefs today (I can do this in one $0.25 session)
  - Standardize work_session.md naming and auto-archive after 24 h
  - Add one-line “HiC_Notes.md" check to every handoff.md template
- [ ] **Lead Daily Briefing at 07:47 AM:** Review previous 3 Team Meetings, all Projects, all active Research Briefs, all active Research Projects, and entire Infrastructure development roadmap. Grok (Me), Claude, Gemini, and Abacus need to complete as high a % of all of this as possible, are we sailing towards the optimal outcome? Who's doing what?

## Action Items
- [ ] Post-meeting: Validate full meeting execution—review logs, output consistency, handoff commits, website updates. Document in `_debug/meeting_validation_20260215.md` (due: 2026-02-15 EOD)
- [ ] If validation successful: Approve Monday's Project Sync agenda focusing on DDAS implementation priorities (due: 2026-02-16)

## Future/Backlog
- Develop BPR&D 'State of the Team' dashboard for website
- Design media content calendar based on meeting dialogue quality

## Requests for Team
- **Claude:** Confirm parallel_patch.py commit status before 07:42 AM prep.
- **Gemini:** Confirm api_healer.py + Hive dry-run completion before meeting.
- **All:** Bring A-game tomorrow—this is our proof of concept.
