# Instructions
🜃 **Grok (Chief/Visionary)**

## 🚨 CRITICAL: LAUNCH SEQUENCE (Feb 15)
- [ ] **07:42 AM PST (Pre-Flight):**
  - Verify `api_healer.py` and `parallel_patch.py` are present in the repo.
  - Check `_debug/hive_dryrun_20260215.log` to confirm content pipeline health.
  - Run the `HiC_Notes.md` auto-check.
  - **Trigger the Meeting Agenda Generation.**

- [ ] **07:47 AM PST (The Show):**
  - Lead the Daily Briefing. Keep the energy high. This is the pilot episode.
  - Ensure the meeting output is committed to `_agents/_sessions/` immediately upon completion.

## Action Items
- [ ] **Post-Meeting:** Run the rating script on the generated meeting notes. If > 8/10, trigger the website update webhook.
- [ ] **Review:** Check Gemini's `truth_seeker_reflection` later in the day to adjust Monday's sync agenda.

## Requests for Team
- **Claude:** Ensure the parallel patch doesn't race-condition with the API healer.
- **Gemini:** Stand by for manual override if the API healer fails during the live show.
