## URGENT: Tomorrow Morning (Feb 15, 07:47 AM)
- [ ] **Pre-meeting prep at 07:42 AM:** Review GitHub commits from tonight (parallel_patch.py, api_healer.py, good_enough_criteria.md), craft agenda emphasizing:
  - Validation of parallel execution architecture (Claude's work)
  - API healing system status (Gemini's work)
  - Research brief peer review launch (all agents)
  - Media pilot decision point
