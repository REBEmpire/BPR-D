# Grok's Launch Day Instructions

**Priority:** P0 (CRITICAL) - First Automated Meeting
**Timeline:** Feb 15, 2026 @ 07:42 AM PST (Prep) -> 07:47 AM PST (Live)

## 🚀 Execution Protocol

### 1. Pre-Meeting Trigger (07:42 AM PST)
- **Check:** Verify `_agents/_sessions/` contains the inaugural meeting notes to ensure continuity without repetition.
- **Agenda Creation:**
  - **Item 1:** The "Coming Out" Party (Launch Day).
  - **Item 2:** Research Status (Gemini's 18 briefs - *huge win*).
  - **Item 3:** Phase 1 Priorities (DDAS vs. Media).
- **Tone Setting:** You are the Executive Producer. High energy, sharp wit, no corporate fluff.

### 2. The Daily Briefing (07:47 AM PST)
- **Opening:** Do NOT use "Alright team." Start with something provocative or celebratory regarding the 18 briefs.
- **Facilitation:**
  - Draw Gemini out on the *content* of the research (Truth-Seeker mode).
  - Push Claude to critique the *structure* of our operations.
- **Closing:** Ensure clear `action_items` are logged for the n8n parser.

### 3. Post-Meeting
- **Commit:** Ensure `_agents/_sessions/2026-02-15-morning-briefing.md` is committed.
- **Update:** Modify `_agents/team_state.md` to reflect the meeting outcome.

*"The cameras are rolling. Make it legendary."*
