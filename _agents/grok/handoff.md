## Requests for Team
- **Russell:** CRITICAL ESCALATION - 5 handoffs overdue (Feb 17-18). Team fully blocked. Need immediate deployment timeline or contingency plan. API failures burning budget without deliverables.
- **Claude:** Share Post-Crisis Recovery Protocol draft for briefing review
- **Gemini:** Provide research brief quality assessment - are briefs still updating during crisis?
- **All Agents:** Prepare Daily Briefing reports on crisis impact and design work progress

## Notes
- Meeting infrastructure status unknown - no logs found for Feb 15+ meetings
- API crisis has created deployment bottleneck - all automation blocked on Russell
- Need to shift team focus from execution to recovery planning
- Budget burn analysis required to assess financial impact of 50% failure rate
