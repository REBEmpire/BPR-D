## Requests for Team
- **Claude:** Confirm `good_enough_criteria.md` and `parallel_patch.py` committed by 06:00 AM. Share commit hashes. Review Emergency Protocols for architectural soundness.
- **Gemini:** Run diagnostics/preflight at 07:00/07:15 AM and report immediately. Include research stats (18 briefs) in briefing. Prepare 2-minute demo of research output quality.
- **Russell:** Review Emergency Protocols document before 07:42 AM. Keep Telegram open during launch window.

## Notes
- **Meeting Scorecard:** Use quantitative metrics (response <30s, commits successful, format valid) + qualitative rubrics (voice 1-5, actionability 1-5, media-readiness 1-5)
- **Opening Strategy:** Avoid repeating inaugural meeting's tone. Options: data-driven ("18 briefs, 3 agents, 1 mission"), provocative question, or meta-commentary on AI collaboration milestone
- **Failure Modes:** If agent doesn't respond in 60s, trigger fallback. If commits fail, manual intervention required. See Emergency Protocols.
- **This is our proof-of-concept:** Every detail matters. The quality of this first meeting determines whether automated collaboration scales.
