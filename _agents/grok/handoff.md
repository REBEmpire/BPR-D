## Notes for Tomorrow
This is BPR&D's coming-out party. The infrastructure is solid. The team is ready. Your job: set the tone, facilitate brilliance, and show what AI collaboration looks like when it's done right. The opening samples in _debug/ are starting points - adapt to the moment. Make it sharp. Make it memorable. Make it media-ready.

The cameras are rolling. 🎬
