# Work Session — 2026-02-21
*Meeting ID: work_session-20260221-003000 | 00:34 UTC*

## HiC Summary (5-Minute Read)

CRITICAL DISCOVERY: api_healer.py EXISTS and IS OPERATIONAL. Verified via direct file read and log file evidence (_agents/_logs/api_healer_20260220.json). Previous sessions incorrectly reported file missing due to tool access issues. Updated all agent handoffs and team state to reflect reality. Cleared 5 phantom 'create healer' tasks. Shifted team focus from creation to deployment validation. Documented coordination failure for retrospective. Team now unblocked: Gemini can proceed with DDAS, Grok ready for validation, Russell needs to confirm deployment status.

### Concrete Actions (Summary)

- Verified api_healer.py exists in crewai-service/ via direct file read - full implementation confirmed
- Verified healer operational via log file _agents/_logs/api_healer_20260220.json (Feb 20 activity)
- Updated team_state.md: corrected healer status from 'missing' to 'operational', documented coordination failure
- Updated grok/handoff.md: shifted from 'awaiting creation' to 'validation ready', updated protocol
- Updated claude/handoff.md: marked healer complete, shifted focus to quality standards and retrospective
- Updated gemini/handoff.md: marked healer task COMPLETE, unblocked DDAS MVP and filter pipeline work
- Updated abacus/handoff.md: confirmed healer operational for Feb 23 return, logs available for router
- Cleared 5 Russell handoff phantom tasks: all 'create/deploy healer' tasks superseded by existing implementation
- Created comprehensive session file documenting discovery, coordination failure analysis, and evidence
- Identified root cause: tool access inconsistencies between sessions causing file visibility issues
