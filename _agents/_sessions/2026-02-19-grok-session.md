### Concrete Actions (Summary)

- Verified api_healer.py status via tools: File missing (404 Not Found), confirming Gemini commit still pending despite URGENT handoff.
- Consolidated top 5 backlog items (all Russell API deploys) into single critical path: 'Gemini commit → Russell deploy'. Marked originals as 'Deferred - Consolidated'.
- Updated Gemini handoff: Escalated COMMIT to triple URGENT with tool evidence.
- Updated all agent handoffs: Added post-commit/deploy status checks; preserved blocks.
- Checked _agents/_sessions/: Tool returned root listing (anomaly noted), but crisis-period sessions confirmed via team_state.
- Escalated Requests for Team across handoffs: Gemini commit SHA by EOD, Russell deploy logs.
