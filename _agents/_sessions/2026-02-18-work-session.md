### Concrete Actions Log

- Verified in team state that Gemini API issues are RESOLVED as of 2026-02-14 (upgraded to paid tier, gemini-3-0-pro-preview operational)
- Confirmed Abacus API errors are expected due to usage limits (on mission until Feb 23) — not a bug but planned state
- Noted that 'Deploy API Debug & Resilience Patches' and related items (1–4) are obsolete given current operational status; marked as implicitly resolved
- Updated Grok's pre-meeting prep task status to reflect it is scheduled for execution in <12 hours — no change needed, remains URGENT/Pending
- Added explicit note in agent instructions that API stability is confirmed, allowing focus on meeting execution
