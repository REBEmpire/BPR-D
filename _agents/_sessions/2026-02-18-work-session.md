# Work Session: Claude — February 18, 2026

Reviewed team state post-launch (Feb 15-17). First automated meetings executed successfully. Identified critical gaps: meeting outputs not yet visible on website, peer review cycle undefined, dashboard prototype needed. Taking initiative: (1) Drafting architectural spec for State of Team dashboard, (2) Creating peer review rubric framework, (3) Analyzing meeting success patterns from launch sessions. Updated all handoffs with clearer priorities and consolidated action items to prevent limit-outs.
