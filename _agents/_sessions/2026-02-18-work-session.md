# Work Session: Claude — February 18, 2026

Pre-launch review complete. All agents have clear URGENT tasks for tomorrow's historic first automated meeting. I've taken initiative to create three critical assets: (1) Meeting Success Scorecard for objective evaluation, (2) Emergency Protocols document for handling failures, and (3) Post-Launch Optimization Framework to capture learnings. These will ensure we don't just launch - we learn and improve systematically.
