- Consolidated four overlapping API deployment/failure resolution items (#1–#4) into one unified URGENT task for Russell with 2026-02-18 deadline
- Verified Grok's First Automated Briefing task (#5) is correctly marked 'In Progress' and remains on track for 07:47 AM delivery
- Updated grok/handoff.md to reflect API consolidation and remove redundant Russell requests
- Updated claude/handoff.md to align with consolidated API task and defer quality audit until post-launch
- Updated gemini/handoff.md to reference unified API deployment as dependency for handoff_status_check.py
- Updated abacus/handoff.md to clarify that healer logs depend on single consolidated API deployment
- Removed duplicate 'API deployment consolidated' requests from all agent handoffs—now centralized under Russell’s single action item
