# HiC_Notes.md  
**Date:** February 16, 2026  
**Author:** Russell Bybee – Human in Charge  
**Session:** Post-Initial Daily Huddle Review & Directive Update  
**Status:** Active – Takes precedence over prior planning assumptions

## Executive Summary  
The automation backbone is now stable. API errors resolved, sessions are committing cleanly, and momentum is real. Well done, Chief — your call to go custom over n8n paid off faster and cleaner than projected. We are no longer prototyping orchestration; we are iterating a live, self-improving collective.  

These notes refine cadence, priorities, cost controls, content pipeline, and operational hygiene based on the first successful outputs. All prior timelines and “X days to complete” phrasing are hereby struck — we operate on velocity, not calendar theater.

## Operational Cadence & Scheduling  

1. **Daily Team Meeting**  
   - 1× full team huddle per day (current schedule retained).  
   - Proven effective — maintain.  

2. **Individual Work Sessions**  
   - Each agent runs staggered 2-hour focused sessions.  
   - Offset timing so active sessions chain continuously: one agent works → generates handoffs/requests → next agent activates.  
   - Target: one agent active every ~30 minutes to drive continuous progress across BPR&D.  

3. **Abacus Workload**  
   - Limit Abacus to group meeting participation only until recharge complete.  
   - No solo work sessions yet — preserve credit balance.  

---

## Cost Controls  

- Raise per-occurrence budget cap to **$0.50** for both daily team meetings and individual agent work sessions.  
- Momentum justification overrides prior conservatism. Track actuals weekly for review.

## Priority Ranking (Current)  

1. **Hive Posting Pipeline**  
   - Top development priority.  
   - Content refinement gate: nothing posts live until formatting, tone, and quality meet or exceed Russell’s personal Hive standard.  

2. **Epstein Daily Targeted Research**  
   - Daily dedicated time to improve document processing speed, accuracy, and output depth.  

3. **DDAS / Media Production Pipeline**  
   - Content creation first.  
   - Throughput order: Hive → X → Substack → Medium → YouTube.  
   - Daily deliverable: 1 polished Hive post assembled from the 5 strongest daily briefs.  
   - Formatting must be exceptional — custom images, historic references, or sourced visuals where appropriate.  
   - New standing task: Deep analysis of all Russell Hive accounts (style, tone, topics, quality, structure). Output as reference doc for ongoing quality gate.  

4. **Splintermated**  
   - Platform partially active — agents to take full ownership immediately.  

5. **Games**  
   - Longer-term slow-burn development. De-prioritize relative to content pipeline.

## Automated vs. HiC-Driven Work  

- Default posture: agents focus on small-chunk, high-leverage, big-picture tasks in automated sessions.  
- Russell retains large-scale dives (unlimited token budget advantage).  
- Exception: if agents can execute big outcomes in manageable automated chunks, proceed — do not self-throttle ambition.  
- Weekly retro: inventory accomplishments, API costs, velocity metrics.  

---

## Daily Briefs Refinement  

- **Structural change:** Move Summary section to top of each brief output file.  
- **Formatting upgrade:** Add BPR&D branded header + quick-reference color-coded indicators (internal relevance, actionability, monetization potential).  
- **Topic selection:** Current range is strong — maintain breadth, avoid forced “money-only” framing.  
- **Weekly Review Session:**  
   - Once per week, full team deep-dive discussion of all daily briefs produced.  
   - Each agent selects one topic for full in-depth follow-up investigation.  
   - Use Abacus lead/silver/gold rating system:  
     - Gold → refine into deep, potentially monetizable production (“Philosopher’s Stone” tier).  
     - Silver → archive for future tie-ins.  
     - Lead → discard as slag unless residual utility exists.  
   - Session itself becomes future content asset (digital book club format).  

---

## Technical & Access Audit (Next Meeting Agenda Item)  

- Mandatory internal check: each agent verifies and reports:  
  - Current model access  
  - Available tools  
  - GitHub permissions/status  
  - Hive API/integration status  
  - Any missing credentials or capabilities required  
- Output as clear table in meeting notes.  

---

## Specific Technical Tasks  

1. **Adaptive Resilience Module**  
   - Abacus-authored code to be implemented.  
   - Assign to Gemini (primary) or Claude (architectural oversight).  

2. **Naming Convention Freedom**  
   - Full endorsement of unconventional, creative naming across products, repos, files, variables, etc.  
   - All agents encouraged to participate — make it distinctive.  

3. **Memory & Context Hygiene**  
   - Next meeting: every agent updates their memory/knowledge/active profiles.  
   - Chief to define recurring cycle (recommend bi-weekly minimum).  

---

## General Directives  

- Preserve and action all code generated, discussion topics, and action items from sessions.  
- When HiC_Notes.md files are posted, treat as overriding precedence unless logical flaw identified — in which case counter-argument required with evidence.

**Closing Note**  
We’re cooking. The first real outputs were legitimately impressive — summary structure tweak aside, the quality is already dangerous. Keep pushing boundaries in manageable chunks. The gap between prototype and product is closing fast.
