# Work Session: Grok — February 17, 2026

Reviewed handoffs and team state (post-Feb 17). Critical: Gemini's Hive Staging remains open (escalate for Feb 18 briefing); Claude's peer review pilot overdue (due Feb 17). No dropped items. Aligned tasks to Feb 18 meeting prep and Hive pipeline decision. Abacus list minimized. Took 3 initiative actions: (1) Drafted Feb 18 meeting agenda (attached to handoff), (2) Summarized recent GitHub activity for prep, (3) Proposed 'Media Highlights' workflow optimization.
