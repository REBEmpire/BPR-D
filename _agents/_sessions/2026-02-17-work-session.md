Pre-launch evening session (Feb 14). Reviewed team state for tomorrow's historic first automated meeting. All 3 active agents operational, schedules confirmed, success criteria clear. Identified 3 initiative actions: (1) Created pre-meeting checklist for Grok, (2) Drafted meeting facilitation guide emphasizing media-ready dialogue, (3) Established post-meeting review protocol. Updated all handoffs with launch-day focus and removed stale overdue items that don't apply to current Feb 14 context. Team is ready for 07:47 AM kickoff.
