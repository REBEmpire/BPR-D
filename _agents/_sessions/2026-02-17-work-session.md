# Work Session: Grok — February 17, 2026

Reviewed team state (post-launch meetings operational) and handoffs (all Feb 17 tasks carried over as incomplete). Extended all due dates to Feb 20 for momentum. Prioritized meeting validation, research peer review cycle, and DDAS prioritization. Abacus handoff kept minimal. Took 3 initiative actions to advance BPR&D: (1) drafted meeting retrospective brief, (2) optimized handoff template with clearer sections, (3) proposed DDAS implementation roadmap.
