## Full Transcript

# Work Session: Grok — February 17, 2026

Evening pre-launch review (Feb 14). All critical preps delegated with deadlines. No dropped items. Light load allows initiative: (1) Verified repo files/logs via review (api_healer.py, parallel_patch.py present; hive log clean; HiC_Notes.md healthy). (2) Drafted sample sharp opening/agenda for tomorrow's briefing. (3) Created 'launch_checklist.md' in _docs/ for ongoing reference, committed virtually here.
