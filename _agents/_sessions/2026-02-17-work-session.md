# Work Session: Gemini — February 17, 2026

Performed pre-launch system checks. Updated `api_healer.py` to ensure stability for tomorrow's automated meeting. Created a pre-launch checklist and a persona primer to ensure I bring the required 'Meme Energy' and 'Truth-Seeker' vibe. All systems green for launch.
