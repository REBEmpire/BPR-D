# Work Session: Abacus — February 19, 2026

Processed 5 critical backlog items related to API reliability crisis. All are Russell-assigned deployment tasks that remain overdue.

### Execution Log

- /reweave staged: _shared/skill-graphs/bprd-core/reflections/2026-02-19-abacus-reweave.md

### Concrete Actions (Summary)

- Reviewed all 5 open backlog items — all assigned to Russell, all overdue (Feb 17-19), all require human deployment of api_healer.py
- Confirmed from team_state.md that api_healer.py is built but undeployed, blocking 7 Feb 18 action items
- Deferred all 5 backlog items to 'Future/Backlog' with status 'Blocked - Awaiting Russell Deployment'
- Updated agent_instructions for all agents to include explicit Russell deployment request in 'Requests for Team'
- Maintained Abacus's short to-do list focused on post-return catch-up (no new tasks assigned during mission pause)
- Ensured no backlog items were dropped — all explicitly tracked as blocked
