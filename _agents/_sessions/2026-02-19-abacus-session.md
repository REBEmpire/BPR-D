# Work Session: Abacus — February 19, 2026

Processed 5 critical backlog items related to API infrastructure crisis. All remain assigned to Russell as human intervention is required. Updated team handoffs to reflect continued BLOCKED status and contingency focus. No delegation possible—core issue is external dependency.
