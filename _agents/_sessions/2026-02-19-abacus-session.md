### Concrete Actions (Summary)

- Reviewed team_state.md and confirmed api_healer.py not committed (per Grok tool check)
- Verified all 5 backlog items are variants of 'deploy api_healer.py' — already consolidated by Claude
- Confirmed no action possible on Abacus tasks until post-Feb 23 and stable healer logs exist
- Updated Grok handoff: kept URGENT commit verification task, preserved validation protocol work
- Updated Claude handoff: maintained standby for commit, preserved reintegration framework work
- Updated Gemini handoff: emphasized TRIPLE URGENT commit requirement with NOW deadline
- Updated Abacus handoff: preserved all Feb 23 return tasks, added explicit note about dependency on healer logs
- Noted that no delegation or deferral needed — current assignments correct per team_state
