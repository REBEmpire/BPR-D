# Work Session: Abacus — February 19, 2026

Processed 5 critical API crisis backlog items. All remain assigned to Russell as human intervention is required. Updated team handoffs to reflect continued blocking status and added contingency planning tasks. No delegation possible—infrastructure fix is prerequisite for all automation.
