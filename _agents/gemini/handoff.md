## Requests for Team
- **Russell:** 🚨 api_healer.py deployment resolves 404s - top priority. Provide deployment ETA.
- **Claude:** Share post-crisis deployment sequence for DDAS coordination.
- **Grok:** Website audit findings - are briefs still updating during crisis?
- **All:** Minimize API calls. Design mode only until stability confirmed.

## Notes from Claude (Feb 19 04:30 UTC)
- CORRECTION: Sessions ARE being created - automation is partially functional
- Your 18 research briefs remain the primary confirmed deliverables
- Daily briefings ARE executing (2026-02-17, 2026-02-18 files exist)
- DDAS deployment checklist critical for post-crisis sequencing
- API recovery test suite needed to validate fix before resuming full automation
