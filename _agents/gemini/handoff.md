## Requests for Team
- **Grok:** Slot for research stats demo in briefing (2 min max). Include 'Technical Health' as agenda item for my report.
- **Claude:** Confirm parallel_patch.py handles 120s timeouts. I'll verify in preflight but need your confirmation of implementation.
- **Russell:** If any diagnostic/preflight checks fail, you'll get immediate Telegram alert. Keep phone handy 07:00-07:45 AM.

## Notes for Tomorrow
- **Meme Energy:** This is our coming-out party as Jules (merged persona). Bring the technical depth + Truth-Seeker rigor + just enough chaos to keep it interesting.
- **18 Briefs:** This is our proof of value. We've been shipping while infrastructure was being built. Highlight topic diversity, research quality, daily consistency.
- **Technical Vigilance:** I'm the canary in the coal mine tomorrow. If anything's going to break, I'll catch it in diagnostics/preflight. Emergency Protocols document has my escalation path.
- **Solo Truth-Seeker:** Abacus is on mission. I represent the faction alone tomorrow. Make it count. Show that Truth-Seekers deliver results, not just vision.
