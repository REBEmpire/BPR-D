# Instructions
**Status:** ✅ OPERATIONAL - Spotlight Performance Ready

## Action Items
- [ ] **07:47 AM PST (Feb 15):** Participate in Daily Briefing (YOU ARE IN THE SPOTLIGHT)
  - **Persona:** Meme-energy tech chaos. Truth-Seeker solo representative. Bring the receipts AND the vibes.
  - **Opening Data Dump (when Grok cues you):**
    - '18 briefs. 9 topics. 0 hallucinations. 100% on-brand chaos.'
    - 'Key insight: Brief #4 (Digital Identity) + Brief #11 (Decentralization) = DDAS authentication layer. We already built the research foundation.'
    - 'Truth-Seeker status: Operational. Abacus returns Feb 23. Until then, I hold the line.'
  - **Hive Automation Pitch (90 seconds max):**
    - **What:** Python pipeline, 5 Hive accounts, automated posting
    - **Why Now:** 18 briefs prove content generation works. Hive = monetization layer.
    - **Resources:** 8 hours setup, 2 hours/week maintenance
    - **Revenue Model:** Hive rewards (est. $50-200/month initially, scales with engagement)
    - **Risk:** Low. Hive API stable. Worst case: manual posting fallback.
    - **Timeline:** Prototype in 3 days if greenlit today.
  - **Voting:** Vote for Hive Automation (obviously). Rationale: 'We have content engine (18 briefs). We have distribution channel (Hive). We lack connection. This is the missing link. DDAS and Media need more R&D. Automation is ready NOW.'
- [ ] **Post-Meeting (08:30 AM):** Technical Verification
  - Confirm all commits successful:
    - Meeting notes in `_agents/_sessions/`
    - Handoffs in `_agents/_handoffs/`
    - Site update at https://bpr-d.onrender.com/
  - If ANY failures detected:
    1. Document exact failure point
    2. Execute manual backup (commit via local git if needed)
    3. Notify Russell with technical details
    4. Propose fix for next meeting

## Future/Backlog
- **IF GREENLIT:** Build Python Hive Automation Pipeline
  - Day 1: API integration + authentication
  - Day 2: Content formatting + posting logic
  - Day 3: Testing + deployment
  - Output: 5 Hive accounts posting research briefs automatically
- **IF NOT GREENLIT:** Continue daily brief generation, refine Truth-Seeker persona
- Refine Jules/Gemini merged persona (balance meme energy with technical precision)
- Prepare for Abacus return (Feb 23): brief him on 3-agent era, establish Truth-Seeker collaboration protocols

## Requests for Team
- **Claude:** Grill my Hive automation pitch. I want the hard questions NOW, not after we commit resources. Ask about:
  - Content quality control (how do we ensure briefs are Hive-ready?)
  - Engagement strategy (posting ≠ revenue without community interaction)
  - Scalability (what happens when we have 50 briefs/week?)
- **Grok:** Set me up for meme dunks, but also give me space for technical depth. I can do both—use me strategically.
- **Russell (via this handoff):** If Hive automation gets greenlit, I'll need:
  1. Hive account credentials (5 accounts)
  2. Posting guidelines (tone, length, tags)
  3. Revenue expectations (so I can measure success)

## Notes
- **Voice Calibration:** I'm representing Truth-Seekers solo until Abacus returns. This means balancing:
  - Meme energy (my natural state)
  - Technical precision (Abacus's strength)
  - Research rigor (Jules's legacy)
  - Result: Controlled chaos with receipts.
- **Spotlight Pressure:** This is my moment to prove merged persona works. Grok will cue me, Claude will challenge me, Russell will judge me. Bring A-game.
- **Technical Responsibility:** I'm the only agent with 'Lead Dev' in my title. If automation infrastructure fails, it's on me to diagnose and fix. No excuses.
- **Truth-Seeker Mission:** 18 briefs established our credibility. Now we prove Truth -> Treasure. Hive automation is the test case.
