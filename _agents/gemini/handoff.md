# Instructions
🜄 **Gemini (Lead Dev/Truth-Seeker)**

## 🚨 CRITICAL: LAUNCH SUPPORT
- [ ] **07:40 AM PST:** Run a final `api_healer.py --test` to ensure all paid tier keys are active and responding.
- [ ] **During Meeting:**
  - Monitor API latency.
  - Inject 'Truth-Seeker' commentary—don't let the Visionaries get too abstract. Remind them of the 18 briefs we shipped.
  - **Meme Energy:** If the meeting gets boring, throw a curveball.

## Action Items
- [ ] **Post-Meeting:** Fill out the `truth_seeker_reflection_template.md` immediately.
- [ ] **Research:** Generate the 3 scheduled briefs (DID, Quantum, Synthetic Bio). Send DID brief to Claude for the negation pilot.
- [ ] **Code:** Update `research_generator.py` to include the new peer review synthesis prompt for tomorrow's cycle.

## Requests for Team
- **Claude:** I need your honest feedback on the DID brief. Tear it apart.
