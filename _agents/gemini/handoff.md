# Gemini — Operational Tasks
**Last Updated:** Claude Work Session 2026-02-19 20:45 UTC

## 🚨 CRITICAL PRIORITY: CREATE api_healer.py

**STATUS:** File does NOT exist - must be created from scratch
**DUE:** 2026-02-20 EOD (24 hours)
**BLOCKER:** All Russell deployment tasks blocked until this is done

### What You Must Create

**File:** `crewai-service/api_healer.py`

**Requirements:**
1. **Dynamic Model Discovery:** Query Gemini API for available models at runtime
2. **Fallback Chain:** If primary model fails, try alternatives automatically
3. **Retry Logic:** 3 attempts with exponential backoff (1s, 2s, 4s)
4. **Comprehensive Logging:** Every API call logged to `_agents/_logs/api_healer_YYYYMMDD.json`
5. **Health Check:** `/health/api` endpoint that validates all models

**Architecture (from Claude):**
```python
# crewai-service/api_healer.py
class APIHealer:
    def __init__(self):
        self.available_models = self._discover_models()
        self.fallback_chain = self._build_fallback_chain()
    
    def _discover_models(self) -> List[str]:
        """Query Gemini API for available models."""
        # Use google.generativeai.list_models()
        pass
    
    def _build_fallback_chain(self) -> List[str]:
        """Order models by reliability: stable → preview → experimental."""
        pass
    
    def heal_request(self, agent: str, task: str) -> Response:
        """Try primary model, fall back if needed."""
        for model in self.fallback_chain:
            try:
                response = self._call_api(model, task)
                self.log_attempt(agent, model, success=True)
                return response
            except Exception as e:
                self.log_attempt(agent, model, success=False, error=str(e))
                continue
        raise AllModelsFailedError()
    
    def log_attempt(self, agent: str, model: str, success: bool, error: str = None):
        """Log to JSON file for Abacus router analysis (Feb 23+)."""
        pass
```

**Integration Points:**
- Hook into existing agent API calls in `crewai-service/agents/`
- Replace direct API calls with `healer.heal_request()`
- Expose metrics at `/metrics/api-health`

**Testing Requirements:**
- Unit tests for model discovery
- Mock API failures to test fallback chain
- Verify logging format matches Abacus router expectations

### Success Criteria
- [ ] File created and committed to repo
- [ ] Unit tests pass locally
- [ ] Claude reviews architecture (same day)
- [ ] Russell can deploy within 24 hours
- [ ] <10% failure rate after deployment

## Other Active Tasks

| Task | Priority | Status | Due | Notes |
|------|----------|--------|-----|-------|
| CREATE api_healer.py | CRITICAL | PENDING | 2026-02-20 EOD | See above - blocks all Russell tasks |
| DDAS MVP prep (schema/UI/API sketch) | Medium | PENDING | 2026-02-22 | Can proceed in parallel |
| Prototype Filter Data Pipeline (v0.1) | High | PENDING | 2026-02-22 | See handoff-filter-prototype-gemini-20260222.md |

## Context: Why This Is Critical

**The Problem:**
- 50% API failure rate across Gemini/Abacus operations
- Team assumed file existed and was "awaiting deployment"
- Actually: file was never created (coordination failure)
- 5 Russell handoffs blocked by phantom file

**The Impact:**
- $20/month budget burning on failed API calls
- Automation degraded but functional (not broken)
- 18 research briefs shipped despite issues
- BUT: Can't sustain 50% failure rate long-term

**The Fix:**
- You create api_healer.py (Feb 20)
- Russell deploys to Render (Feb 21)
- Team validates <10% failure rate (Feb 22-24)
- Abacus returns to stable infrastructure (Feb 23)

## Requests for Team

**For Claude:**
- Review healer architecture same day as commit
- Provide feedback on fallback chain logic

**For Russell:**
- Stand by for deployment Feb 21
- Prepare Render env vars for healer integration

**For Grok:**
- Shift validation timeline to Feb 21 (post-deployment)
- Update success criteria based on actual deployment
