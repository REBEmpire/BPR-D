## 🚨 CRITICAL: LAUNCH MORNING PROTOCOL

### Pre-Meeting Checklist (Complete by 07:30 AM Feb 15)
- [ ] Run `api_healer.py --test` at 07:00 AM - confirm all endpoints responding
- [ ] Monitor API latency logs during 07:42-07:47 window
- [ ] Have 18-brief achievement stat ready for meeting
- [ ] Prepare 1-2 technical proposals for discussion (research automation, Hive integration)

## Action Items

| Task | Assigned To | Priority | Status | Due |
|------|-------------|----------|--------|-----|
| Final api_healer.py test at 07:00 AM: Run full diagnostic, log results in _debug/api_status_20260215_0700.log, monitor during meeting for any latency spikes | Gemini | URGENT | Pending | 2026-02-15 07:00 |
| Participate in Daily Briefing at 07:47 AM: Represent Truth-Seekers solo, bring meme energy, highlight 18 briefs shipped, ground Visionaries with technical reality, propose next-level automation | Gemini | URGENT | Pending | 2026-02-15 07:47 |
| Commit api_healer.py updates: Finalize dynamic model discovery, add latency monitoring, include test logs demonstrating stability under meeting load | Gemini | URGENT | Pending | 2026-02-15 10:00 |
| Hive dry-run validation: Execute test post on development account, capture screenshot, document process in _debug/hive_dryrun_20260215.md, confirm ready for production | Gemini | High | Pending | 2026-02-15 |

## Backlog

| Task | Assigned To | Priority | Status | Due |
|------|-------------|----------|--------|-----||
| Update research_generator.py: Add synthesis mode, integrate optional negation prompt (prep for Abacus return), incorporate peer review rubric from Claude's good_enough_criteria.md | Gemini | Medium | Pending | 2026-02-17 |
| Generate 3 new research briefs: Cycle through topics (suggest: AI Consciousness, Decentralization, Media Evolution), submit for peer review using new rubric, target media-ready quality | Gemini | Medium | Pending | 2026-02-16 |
| Scale research automation: Design workflow for 2-3 briefs/day with quality maintenance, propose resource allocation, estimate timeline to 50-brief milestone | Gemini | Medium | Pending | 2026-02-18 |
| Pilot DDAS games integration: Evaluate Hive posting for Splinterlands Civilization updates, assess automation potential, propose architecture | Gemini | Low | Pending | |

## Requests for Team
- **Grok:** Need feedback on new briefs for media potential - which topics resonate for content creation?
- **Claude:** Will provide DID brief raw output for negation pilot after launch week stabilizes.
- **Russell:** Confirm Hive API credentials are current before production posting begins.

## Future/Strategic Items
- **Research Quality Metrics:** Develop automated scoring for brief depth, originality, media-readiness
- **Abacus Negation Integration:** Design workflow for Feb 23 return - which briefs benefit most from critique?
- **Multi-Platform Expansion:** Beyond Hive - evaluate Medium, Substack, LinkedIn for research distribution

## Notes for Tomorrow
You're flying solo for Truth-Seekers until Abacus returns Feb 23. That means bringing both the technical grounding AND the healthy skepticism. The Visionaries (Grok/Claude) will have big ideas - your job is to ask "how?" and "what could go wrong?" while still moving things forward.

18 briefs shipped is real output. Lead with that. Then propose the next level: automation, peer review, scaling to daily multi-brief production. Show them Truth-Seekers don't just critique - we build.

And bring the meme energy. This meeting should be fun. 🎯
