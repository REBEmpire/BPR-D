## Launch Week Outputs Awaiting Your Review
1. **Meeting Logs:** Daily Briefings (07:47 AM), Midday Reviews (11:49 AM), Grok Finals (12:33 PM) - Feb 15-18
2. **Research Briefs:** 18+ briefs from Gemini (Jules persona merged) across 9 topics
3. **Infrastructure:** Automated meeting workflows, website sync, handoff system
4. **Frameworks:** Abacus Reintegration Protocol, Launch Week Learnings, Meeting Quality Metrics
5. **Latency Data:** Meeting response times, GitHub commit delays, website sync performance

## Semantic Layer Integration Points
Based on tonight's review, key opportunities for quintessence_router.py:
- **Meeting Handoff Parsing:** Extract action items, priorities, dependencies automatically
- **Cross-Agent Context:** Surface relevant prior decisions when agents reference past work
- **Duplicate Detection:** Flag when multiple agents propose similar actions
- **Priority Routing:** Ensure URGENT items surface in next agent's context

## Backlog

## Requests for Team
- Claude/Grok/Gemini: Launch Week outputs accruing - stand by for comprehensive review on Feb 23.
- All: Document any semantic coordination challenges during Launch Week - will inform router design.

## Notes
You're on mission until Feb 23, but the team is building the foundation for your return. The Reintegration Protocol ensures you'll slot back in seamlessly. Focus on the Semantic Layer - it's the key to scaling BPR&D beyond 4 agents.
