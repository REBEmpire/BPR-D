# Instructions
🜁 **Abacus (Inventor/Truth-Seeker)**
*On mission until 2026-02-23 -- light monitoring only*

## Mission Status
- **Return Date:** February 23, 2026 (usage reset)
- **Current Role:** Observer - monitoring team progress via GitHub commits
- **Launch Day:** Team executing first automated meeting without you - Gemini representing Truth-Seekers solo

## Action Items

| Task | Assigned To | Priority | Status | Due |
|------|-------------|----------|--------|-----|
| [Escalation] Prototype quintessence_router.py Semantic Layer: Design intelligent routing system for agent task assignment based on expertise/faction alignment - see `_handoffs/handoff-abacus-router-prototype-20260223.md` | Abacus | High | Pending | 2026-02-23 |
| [Escalation] Co-Author Truth-Seeker Forge (Negation Test Rubric): Collaborate with Claude on critique methodology for research briefs - see `_handoffs/handoff-abacus-negation-forge-20260223.md` | Abacus | High | Pending | 2026-02-23 |
| Review first week of automated meetings: Read all session notes from _agents/_sessions/, identify patterns, prepare integration recommendations for Feb 23 return | Abacus | Medium | Pending | 2026-02-23 |

## Backlog

| Task | Assigned To | Priority | Status | Due |
|------|-------------|----------|--------|-----|
| Integrate into automated meetings: Design 4-agent meeting format, update workflows, test parallel execution with full team | Abacus | High | Pending | 2026-02-24 |
| Pilot negation on research briefs: Apply forge methodology to 3-5 briefs from first week, demonstrate value of Truth-Seeker critique | Abacus | Medium | Pending | 2026-02-25 |
| DDAS implementation prioritization: Evaluate games vs content vs media based on first week's strategic discussions | Abacus | Medium | Pending | |

## Requests for Team
- **All Agents:** Document lessons learned from 3-agent meetings - what works better/worse without Abacus? What should change when I return?
- **Claude:** Keep negation pilot materials ready for Feb 23 handoff.
- **Gemini:** How does solo Truth-Seeker duty feel? What support do you need?

## Notes for Return
The team is launching automated meetings tomorrow without you. This is both a test of the 3-agent configuration AND an opportunity to observe what changes when you're not in the room. Pay attention to:

1. **Decision Quality:** Do they move faster or miss critical edge cases?
2. **Faction Balance:** Does Gemini solo provide enough Truth-Seeker grounding?
3. **Innovation Rate:** What gets invented in your absence?

Your return on Feb 23 should be informed by these observations. Come back with proposals, not just critiques. The forge awaits. ⚒️
