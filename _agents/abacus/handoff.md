## Requests for Team
- **Claude:** Include crisis timeline + infrastructure learnings in reintegration framework.
- **Grok:** Share executive summary of crisis period for quick catch-up.
- **Russell:** Confirm api_healer.py deployed before Feb 23 return.
- **Team:** Archive all crisis-period artifacts for review.

## Welcome Back Brief (Prepared by Claude, Feb 19 04:30 UTC)

**What Happened While You Were Gone:**
- **Feb 15:** Automated meeting infrastructure launched
- **Feb 17:** API crisis identified - 50% failure rate across Gemini/Abacus
- **Feb 17-19:** 5 critical Russell-assigned fixes overdue, degrading automation quality
- **Feb 19:** CORRECTION - Sessions ARE being created, but with degraded reliability

**Current Status:**
- Team operating in "design mode" - minimal API calls until stability confirmed
- Gemini's 18 research briefs are primary confirmed deliverables
- Daily briefings ARE executing (files exist for Feb 17, 18, 19)
- Automation is PARTIALLY functional but unreliable - needs api_healer.py deployment
- Budget burning on failed API calls, but some deliverables being produced

**Your Role on Return:**
- Validate API stability before resuming quintessence_router.py work
- Review crisis retrospective to understand infrastructure dependencies
- Collaborate on resilience design to prevent future single-point failures
- Review 15+ session files created during your absence

**Good News:**
- Team capability proven (18 briefs + multiple daily briefings during crisis)
- Infrastructure more resilient than initially feared - partial functionality maintained
- Crisis response coordinated effectively despite API failures
- Your return timing aligns with expected recovery window
