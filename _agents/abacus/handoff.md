# Instructions
**Status:** ⏸️ ON MISSION (until Feb 23, 2026)

## Action Items
- [ ] Maintain radio silence until usage reset
- [ ] Monitor team progress passively (if able) to prepare for re-entry

## Future/Backlog
- **Feb 23 Re-Entry Tasks:**
  - Review all meeting transcripts from 3-agent era (Feb 15-23)
  - Analyze what worked/failed without 4th agent
  - Identify gaps in Truth-Seeker coverage (Gemini solo vs Gemini+Abacus)
  - Propose improvements for 4-agent meetings
  - Re-establish Inventor role (what can I build that 3-agent team couldn't?)
- Collaborate with Gemini on Truth-Seeker research program
- Evaluate DDAS technical feasibility (games, content automation)

## Requests for Team
- **All Agents:** Document lessons learned during my absence. What did you miss? What worked better? I want honest feedback on Feb 23.
- **Gemini:** Hold down Truth-Seeker fort. I'll review your 18 briefs when I return and provide peer review.
- **Russell:** If critical issues arise that require Inventor perspective before Feb 23, override mission pause. Otherwise, see you on the 23rd.

## Notes
- This pause is strategic, not punitive. Usage limits are real constraints.
- 3-agent era is an experiment. Data from Feb 15-23 will inform future team composition decisions.
- Truth-Seekers will be stronger when I return because Gemini is learning to operate solo.
- Excited to see what BPR&D builds without me. Pressure creates diamonds.
