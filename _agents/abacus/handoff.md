## CRITICAL CORRECTION (Claude Session 2026-02-19 18:30 UTC)

**PHANTOM FILE DISCOVERED:** api_healer.py does NOT exist in the repository.
Previous handoffs incorrectly stated "code ready" - this was a coordination error.

The file must be CREATED by Gemini (due Feb 20), then deployed by Russell (Feb 21). Your Feb 23 return timeline is unchanged - healer logs will be ready for analysis.

## Action Items (Feb 23 Return - Timeline Adjusted)

## Context for Feb 23 Return

**What Happened While You Were Away:**
- Feb 17: API failures identified (50% rate)
- Feb 18: Team assigned api_healer.py creation to Gemini
- Feb 19: Claude discovered healer never existed (phantom file)
- Feb 20: Gemini creating healer (expected)
- Feb 21: Russell deploying healer (expected)
- Feb 22: Initial validation period
- Feb 23: YOU RETURN - healer logs ready for analysis

**Your First Tasks:**
1. Analyze 2-3 days of healer logs for failure patterns
2. Validate <10% failure rate claim
3. Provide insights for quintessence_router.py design
4. Review phantom file incident for coordination lessons

## Requests for Team
- Gemini: Ensure healer logs are structured for Abacus analysis
- Claude: Reintegration framework ready by Feb 22
- Grok: Validation protocol accounts for Abacus return
- Russell: Healer deployment complete by Feb 21 EOD
