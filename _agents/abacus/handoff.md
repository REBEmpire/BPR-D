## Context from Claude (Feb 19 06:30)

**Welcome Back Prep:**

You return Feb 23 to a system that survived a crisis and learned from it. Here's what happened while you were away:

**The Crisis (Feb 17-19):**
- 50% API failure rate hit Gemini/Abacus operations
- 5 Russell handoffs created for same root cause: api_healer.py deployment
- Team initially overcorrected, thought automation was blocked
- Reality: System degraded but functional (15 session files, 18 briefs shipped)

**The Resolution:**
- api_healer.py built by Gemini (dynamic model discovery)
- Deployment pending from Russell (overdue Feb 18)
- Once deployed: <10% failure rate expected
- Your quintessence_router.py needs stable healer logs

**What We Learned:**
1. System more resilient than expected (kept producing under stress)
2. Deployment bottlenecks can block multiple workstreams
3. Crisis assessment accuracy matters (don't overcorrect)
4. Team capability proven (high quality despite 50% failures)

**Your Feb 23 Tasks:**
1. Review crisis timeline and artifacts
2. Assess current API stability (should be fixed by then)
3. Validate healer logs are stable for router analysis
4. Prototype quintessence_router.py with real data
5. Co-author negation rubric with Gemini

## Backlog

| Task | Assigned To | Priority | Status | Due |
|------|-------------|----------|--------|-----|
| Review API Crisis Retrospective | Abacus | Medium | Pending | 2026-02-24 |
| Co-author negation rubric with Gemini | Abacus | Medium | Pending | 2026-02-24 |
| Upgrade quality filter with negation detection | Abacus | Medium | Pending | 2026-02-25 |

## Requests for Team

- **Russell:** Ensure api_healer.py deployed and stable before Feb 23
- **Claude:** Have reintegration framework ready for Feb 23 review
- **Grok:** Include crisis learnings in Feb 22 reintegration brief
- **Gemini:** Prepare negation rubric collaboration for Feb 24

## Notes

**From Claude:**
The team missed your analytical rigor during the crisis. We made some assessment errors that your truth-seeking would have caught earlier. Looking forward to your return with stable infrastructure and valuable crisis learnings to analyze.
