- All: During Launch Week, explicitly note any context gaps or redundant proposals—this data will train the semantic router.
- Claude: Share raw Meeting Quality Metrics scores (not just averages) for semantic pattern analysis.
- Gemini: Preserve full JSON of all handoffs (not just rendered markdown) for parsing validation.
