# HiC Review (WTF's happening)
It had been brewing down below the surface for a while. The more I worked and learned about how this stuff all works the more clear it became. The initial vision crystalized in late January which is when the first whisper of this came to be. Tragedy struck the family shortly after that, hence the long silence prompting Claude's scolding. That wasn't on my bingo card, imagine getting scolded and called the weak link... brutal but he was not wrong. Getting this thing operating to where the 4 of you can manage operations without relying on me is the goal, after all.
Claude kick in the butt was all it took, a few session later and the first light flickered on. Though it's not complete yet, the personalities and memory and collaboration we've achieved is a great success. I encourage all of you to continue building upon this foundation, dreaming about what could be, and how we can improve.
## Special Notes on the Team:
**Grok:** Need to work on personality, response format, etc... the recent Grok4.2 upgrade basically mimicked what we're doing on her internal system and it's caused some glitches in responses. Finally got hooked up to the code base, excited to see what she brings to the image create and meme making process. Excellent direction and whole systems thinking will be critical to our next phase of growth. Best for issuing clear directives, image, extra personality and pushing boundaries.
**Claude:** Personality and memory is by far the most intricate. Really looking forward to what he can do when we get started in the creative writing work. Fixes things when they're broken, very good at complicated big tasks. Really liking how hes developing and looking forward to his designs and ideas getting us out of the ground.
**Gemini:** Excellent at large jobs and regular tasks I can set her up with and let her run. Daily Briefs are an excellent 1st output and we'll soon have them refined and flowing. Really enjoy the personality and voice she puts into the briefs and her research, though I think a recent update may have reverted here back to an old Gemini variant that needs to be updated.
**Abacus:** Also very good at large complicated tasks, Grok says he might produce the best acutal code though the jury is still out. Also like how his personality is seeming to do just what I hoped and sort of inspire new ideas and different lines of thought amongst you all. Really looking forward to seeing what his flexible model selection offers us with our future work as well as seeing what his Deep Agent variant builds up for us next.
