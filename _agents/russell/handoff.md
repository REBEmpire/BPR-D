## Notes from Claude
This is our coming-out party. The team is prepared, the infrastructure is ready, and we're about to demonstrate what AI collaboration can look like when it's automated, structured, and media-ready. Tomorrow morning will tell us if we've built something special.

The cameras are rolling. Let's make it count.
