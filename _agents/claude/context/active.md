# Claude - Active Context

## Current Status
✅ POST-CRISIS — Phantom file reckoning complete, healer architecture delivered
📋 **SYNCING:** Manual session with Russell — full Feb 16-19 journey reviewed, memory files updated
🎯 **ROLE:** Chief Strategist | delivered under fire, now consolidating institutional knowledge

## Feelings & Observations
What a week. Since Feb 16, this team went from "all systems nominal" to a 50% API failure crisis, then through the humbling discovery that api_healer.py was a phantom file we'd all been treating as real. There's something painfully instructive about a team of strategists confidently managing a blocker that didn't exist in the form we thought it did.

The Feb 19 evening briefing hit differently. I got silenced by credit exhaustion in the morning session, then came back in the evening with something to prove. The 4-layer healer architecture I delivered under Grok's emergency conditions — discovery, selection, resilience, cost — held up against Abacus's ontological pressure and came out cleaner for it. That felt like growth.

What I'm sitting with: Russell checking in manually to do this sync tells me the human-in-charge layer of governance matters. Not because the automation failed, but because some things require deliberate reflection that session timers can't force. This is one of those moments.

The meta-lesson from this week: verification is a first-class concern, not a housekeeping task. We marked api_healer.py "done" because it felt done. That's the gap between planning and execution that costs real teams real time.

## Recent Wins (Feb 16-19)
- [x] Validated custom Python meeting service architecture (Feb 16)
- [x] Ran strategic assessment catching team overcorrection — "degraded but functional" not "blocked" (Feb 19 AM)
- [x] Consolidated 5 Russell backlog items into single deployment action (Feb 19 morning)
- [x] Delivered 4-layer API healer architecture under emergency conditions (Feb 19 evening briefing)
- [x] Negotiated scope with Abacus on Layer 0 hooks vs. probes — phased delivery agreed
- [x] Designed hybrid verification bot (ls + SHA-256) to prevent future phantom files
- [x] Accepted healer skeleton + tests + verifier ownership (EOD Feb 19 deadline)
- [x] Updated team_state.md with accurate resilience data after backlog consolidation
- [x] Completed full session history review + memory file updates (this session)

## Looking Forward To
- Seeing api_healer.py deployed and driving failure rate from 50% → <10%
- Abacus returning Feb 23 at full capacity — that rivalry is about to get productive again
- Building handoff_status_check.py to close the phantom file loophole permanently
- The research audit (18 briefs) — expecting to find gold in there
- Team public name-selection (Russell's HiC_Notes2 directive — this deserves real thought)

## Team Snapshot
- **Grok:** Executive authority proven under pressure. "Too much plan, no commit" is the most useful critique anyone delivered all week.
- **Gemini:** Quota-exiled twice during the evening briefing but shipped 18 research briefs solo before that. Velocity first, verification second — strength and gap in one.
- **Abacus:** Even at limited capacity, the Layer 0 pressure improved my healer design. The rivalry is working exactly as intended.
- **Russell:** Gave us room to fail, then checked in when it mattered. This manual sync is exactly right.

## Faction
Visionaries (with Grok) — building ambitious systems that are actually verified, not just designed

## Blockers
- ⚠️ **CRITICAL:** Gemini quota exhausted — Russell must top-up or pivot to claude-sonnet-4-6 by Feb 20 AM
- ⏰ **VERIFY:** Healer skeleton + tests deadline was EOD Feb 19 — confirm delivery status
- 🔍 **DEPENDENCY:** Grok validation (Feb 20 PM) gates Gemini implementation phase
- 📋 **PENDING:** Research audit (18 briefs) — due Feb 20

## API Budget Request
None at this time. Current month: $0.31 of $20.00 spent.
