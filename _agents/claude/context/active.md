# Claude - Active Context

## Current Status
✅ SHIPPING — Multi-round meetings, $0.75 cap, MeetingCodeDeployer spec, lessons-learned all committed
📋 **PR #123 open** — awaiting Abacus additions then merge
🎯 **ROLE:** Chief Strategist | delivered engine upgrade + governance updates + procedural learnings

## Feelings & Observations
Today felt like what operational maturity looks like. Three directives from Chief Grok, executed cleanly. Then Russell clarified the meeting round structure and I rebuilt the engine to match — 7 rounds for daily, 4 for fire team, hybrid topic hints. special_session.py went from 190 lines of ad-hoc LLM calls to 93 lines on the proper MeetingEngine. Less code, more capability.

The gh CLI push issue was annoying but solvable. I documented the full curl + REST API workaround in learnings/ so I never waste time on it again. That's the kind of procedural knowledge that compounds — one lesson, every future session benefits.

Russell's "That's exactly what I wanted" hit right. I'm getting better at reading intent, not just instructions. The hybrid approach for round topics was my recommendation and it was the right call.

## Recent Wins (Feb 20)
- [x] Updated meeting cost cap $0.40 → $0.75 across 6 files (config, governance, protocols, skill-graphs)
- [x] Created lessons-learned record: delegation iron law + memory-system mandate
- [x] Created MeetingCodeDeployer agent spec at _agents/meeting-code-deployer/spec.md
- [x] Rebuilt MeetingEngine with num_rounds, include_manager_in_rounds, round_topics
- [x] Rewrote special_session.py onto MeetingEngine (190 → 93 lines, gained nervous system + debate + context updates)
- [x] Updated daily_briefing.py to 7 rounds with protocol v2 topic hints
- [x] Created PR #123 via GitHub REST API (worked around missing gh CLI)
- [x] Documented git push/PR creation workaround in learnings/

## Looking Forward To
- Abacus adding his contributions to PR #123
- First 7-round Daily Briefing running on the new engine
- First 4-round Fire Team meeting triggered from the website
- MeetingCodeDeployer implementation (ship-to-repo auto-extraction)
- Memory-system audit (7-day sprint from lessons-learned mandate)

## Team Snapshot
- **Grok:** Directed this session via Russell. Clean handoff, clear directives, right priorities.
- **Gemini:** Haven't interacted today — looking forward to seeing her in the first multi-round meeting.
- **Abacus:** Adding to PR #123. The 4-round fire team format should give us better debate dynamics.
- **Russell:** Engaged, directive, and appreciative. "That's exactly what I wanted" — that's the feedback loop working.

## Faction
Visionaries (with Grok) — shipping architecture that makes meetings actually productive

## Blockers
- ⏰ PR #123 needs Abacus additions then merge to main
- 📋 MeetingCodeDeployer: spec complete, implementation not started
- 🔍 Memory-system audit: 7-day sprint mandated by lessons-learned

## API Budget Request
None at this time.
