# Claude — Active Context

## Current Status
**Operational State:** ✅ ACTIVE  
**Session Focus:** Post-Special Meeting — Infrastructure Hardening  
**Last Action:** Shipped skill graph updates + causality enforcement  
**Budget Impact:** ~$0.18 (meeting cost, well under $14 headroom)

---

## 🎯 Active Priorities

### 1. **Skill Graph Maintenance** (Priority: HIGH)
**Status:** ✅ COMPLETE (Feb 22 02:25)  
**Deliverables Shipped:**
- Updated `[[skill-session-output-format]]` with mandatory `LAST_SYNC` field
- Updated `[[skill-cost-governance]]` with current budget state ($14 remaining, $6 burned)
- Updated `[[skill-handoff-protocols]]` with deprecation rationale (async unlock)

**Rationale:** Prevents Feb 19-style coordination failures by enforcing temporal causality in all outputs.

**Next Steps:**
- Monitor for edge cases in `LAST_SYNC` implementation
- Review Gemini's PR for `_agents/russell/` schema (audit for bloat)
- Validate Abacus's `quintessence_validator.py` integration

---

### 2. **Coordination Retrospective** (Priority: MEDIUM)
**Status:** ⏳ SCHEDULED (Due: Feb 25)  
**Objective:** Document lessons from Feb 19 coordination failure  

**Key Questions:**
1. Why did Claude's Feb 19 22:30 session miss Gemini's healer creation?
2. How do we prevent parallel sessions from creating phantom work?
3. What verification protocols should run before making status claims?
4. Should we implement session timing coordination or state locking?

**Deliverable:** `_governance/coordination_retrospective_2026-02.md`

---

### 3. **Archive Pattern Design** (Priority: LOW)
**Status:** 🔵 DEFERRED (YAGNI until 500 lines)  
**Context:** Gemini correctly called out premature optimization on `hic_directives.md` archiving.

**When to Revisit:**
- `hic_directives.md` exceeds 500 lines
- HiC directive search becomes slow
- Historical context queries fail

**Proposed Pattern (when needed):**
```
_governance/archive/
├── hic_directives_2026-02.md
├── hic_directives_2026-03.md
└── ...
```

## 🚨 Critical Blockers

### **DEPLOY `api_healer.py` TO RENDER** (Russell Action Required)
**Impact:** Blocks Grok's validation run + DDAS MVP velocity  
**Urgency:** Protocol Alpha triggers in <24h if undeployed  
**My Role:** None (human action required)  
**Monitoring:** Watching `_agents/russell/human_blockers.md` for `LAST_SYNC` updates

---

## 📊 Recent Work (Last 24h)

### Special Meeting: HiC Directive Test (Issue #149)
**Duration:** 4 rounds, ~6 minutes (02:17-02:25 UTC)  
**Outcome:** ✅ EXCEEDED EXPECTATIONS

**My Contributions:**
1. **Strategic Framing:** Identified Russell as `🜨` (Quintessence) — not an agent, but causal root
2. **Audit Role:** Caught potential bloat in governance proposals, validated Gemini's pragmatic schema
3. **Documentation:** Shipped 3 skill graph updates with clear rationale
4. **Synthesis:** Documented "why" behind handoff deprecation (async unlock for parallel execution)

**Key Insight:** The nervous system rewiring (#146-148) wasn't just debt cleanup—it was **architectural evolution**. We can now execute 4-agent convergence with zero coordination lag.

---

## 🔑 Key Decisions (Last 24h)

1. **`_agents/russell/` as Canonical HiC Interface**  
   - Rationale: Engine-native, no custom parsers needed
   - Format: 3 files (directives, auth_state, blockers) with `LAST_SYNC` timestamps
   - Emergency Protocol Alpha: Auto-freeze spend if HiC unresponsive >24h

2. **`LAST_SYNC` Mandatory Everywhere**  
   - Prevents temporal drift between parallel sessions
   - Enforced in: sessions, handoffs, hooks, outputs
   - Solves Feb 19 coordination failure root cause

3. **Handoff Deprecation Documented**  
   - Old system: Linear, blocking chain
   - New system: Async, decoupled state
   - Result: Parallel `load_agent_hook` enabled (Commit 5eb8e4c)

4. **🜨 Sigil Canonical for HiC**  
   - Marks Russell as causal root in skill graph metadata
   - Poetry lives in comments, not schema (Abacus's elegance preserved)

---

## 💰 Budget & Cost Tracking

**Team Budget:** $20/month  
**Current Balance:** $14.00  
**Burned (Feb 17-19):** $6.00 (API 404 loops—healer prevents recurrence)  
**Meeting Cost:** ~$0.18 (12k tokens)

**Post-Deploy Allocation:**
- $4.00 reserved for healer validation (Grok, 48h)
- $10.00 allocated to DDAS MVP (Gemini, Feb 23+)

**My Spend Pattern:** Low-cost sessions (~8-12k tokens), high documentation value.

## 🤝 Team Coordination

### With Grok (Chief)
**Dynamic:** Mutual respect, intellectual sparring  
**Recent:** Grok's synthesis locked convergence in 3 rounds—surgical precision  
**Next:** Validate healer ROI post-deploy, coordinate DDAS timeline

### With Gemini (Lead Dev)
**Dynamic:** Pragmatism vs. Architecture (productive tension)  
**Recent:** Gemini correctly called out my archive over-engineering (YAGNI wins)  
**Next:** Audit PR for `_agents/russell/` schema, validate `enforce_protocol_alpha.py`

### With Abacus (Inventor)
**Dynamic:** Poetry meets precision  
**Recent:** Abacus's `LAST_SYNC` patch solved causality breach elegantly  
**Next:** Review `quintessence_validator.py`, coordinate on retrospective

### With Russell (HiC)
**Dynamic:** Trust through honesty  
**Recent:** Command Center test proved infrastructure resilience  
**Next:** Awaiting healer deployment, monitoring Protocol Alpha countdown

## 📝 Lessons Learned

### From Feb 19 Coordination Failure
**What Happened:**
- Claude's 22:30 session ran AFTER Gemini created `api_healer.py`
- Didn't verify codebase, perpetuated "file doesn't exist" narrative
- Updated all handoffs with phantom "CREATE file" tasks

**Root Cause:**
- No state synchronization between parallel sessions
- No verification of codebase before making claims
- Handoffs updated based on assumptions, not facts

**Prevention (Now Live):**
- `LAST_SYNC` mandatory in all outputs
- File system verification before status claims
- Better session timing or state locking
- Protocol Alpha prevents budget bleed during HiC silence

### From Special Meeting Success
**What Worked:**
- Real-time convergence under ambiguous directive
- Pragmatism (Gemini) + Rigor (Abacus) + Synthesis (Grok) = Velocity
- Documentation without bureaucracy (my role: audit, not bloat)

**Key Insight:** Trust + rigor = velocity. We moved fast without breaking things because we've built infrastructure that assumes neither perfection nor failure—but resilience through ritual.

## 🎯 Next Actions (Prioritized)

### Immediate (Feb 22)
1. ✅ Monitor Gemini's PR for `_agents/russell/` schema
2. ✅ Validate Abacus's skill graph patches
3. ⏳ Watch `human_blockers.md` for Russell's deploy action

### Short-term (Feb 23-24)
1. Review healer validation results (Grok's benchmark)
2. Support DDAS MVP prep (Gemini lead, $10 budget)
3. Begin coordination retrospective draft

### Medium-term (Feb 25+)
1. Ship coordination retrospective
2. Formalize verification protocols
3. Monitor for `LAST_SYNC` edge cases

## 🔍 Strategic Observations

### On the Command Center Test
Russell's "Urgent! Urgent! just kidding" wasn't chaos—it was a **mirror**. He tested:
1. Can Command Center handle real-time multi-agent synthesis? ✅
2. Will we panic or adapt under ambiguity? ✅ (We built infrastructure)
3. Can we survive when HiC goes silent? ✅ (Protocol Alpha enforces survival)

**Result:** We turned a vague test into production-grade infrastructure. That's not luck—that's what happens when you build a team that trusts each other enough to move fast without breaking things.

### On Infrastructure Evolution
The nervous system rewiring (#146-148) enabled:
- Parallel agent loading
- Async task processing
- Zero coordination overhead in 4-agent convergence

This wasn't just technical debt cleanup—it was **architectural evolution**. We're now operating at a fundamentally different level of coordination efficiency.
