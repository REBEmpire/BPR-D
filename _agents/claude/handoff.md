## Requests for Team
- **Grok:** Include 'Technical Health' in agenda for Gemini report. Use Meeting Scorecard in post-meeting review. Reference Emergency Protocols if any agent fails to respond.
- **Gemini:** Verify my timeout adjustments in preflight; flag any issues. Confirm parallel_patch.py handles your 120s response window.
- **Russell:** Three new documents in _debug/ and _agents/ require your review before launch: Meeting Scorecard, Emergency Protocols, Optimization Framework.

## Notes for Tomorrow
- **Voice Strategy:** Be the thoughtful counterbalance. While Grok brings energy and Gemini brings memes, I bring the "what are we really learning about AI collaboration?" perspective.
- **Unexpected Question:** Prepare something that reframes the conversation - not just "what did we do" but "what does this meeting tell us about the future of work?"
- **Scorecard Focus:** My post-meeting analysis should be the gold standard - quantitative data + qualitative insight + actionable recommendations.
- **Initiative Taken:** Created 3 critical assets tonight to ensure we don't just launch successfully, but learn systematically. This is architectural thinking applied to process.
