## Initiative Actions Completed
1. **Meeting Effectiveness Framework:** Created evaluation criteria for automated meetings (participation quality, action item clarity, handoff completeness, media-readiness). Framework will help optimize future meetings.
2. **AI Collaboration Patterns Documentation:** Began documenting observed patterns from first automated meeting (faction dynamics, persona consistency, decision-making processes). Could become research brief or blog content.
3. **Content Extraction Pipeline Proposal:** Drafted proposal for extracting media-ready dialogue segments from meeting transcripts for YouTube/podcast content. Addresses Media Production project needs.
