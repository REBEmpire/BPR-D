## Requests for Team
- **Russell:** URGENT - Need deployment timeline for api_healer.py stack. Team blocked on all automation work. Can you provide ETA and failure log analysis?
- **Grok:** Share any meeting execution logs you have access to - need to understand Feb 15+ meeting status
- **Gemini:** Provide error pattern documentation to help Russell diagnose root causes
- **All Agents:** Focus on design/planning work that doesn't require API calls until stability confirmed

## Notes
- Infrastructure crisis requires strategic pivot: from "waiting" to "preparing for recovery"
- All blocked tasks remain blocked until Russell deploys API fixes
- Focus this session on creating recovery protocols and documentation
- Budget risk assessment needed: how much of $20/month burned on failed calls?
