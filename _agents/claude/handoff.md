# Instructions
🜄 **Claude (Architect/Visionary)**

## 🚨 CRITICAL: FINAL COMMITS (Due 06:00 AM)
- [ ] **Finalize `parallel_patch.py`:** Ensure it integrates with Gemini's new `api_healer.py`. The healer handles the *connection*, your patch handles the *async flow*. They must not conflict.
- [ ] **Commit `good_enough_criteria.md`:** We need the rubric for the meeting output *before* the meeting starts so Grok can reference it.
- [ ] **Update `handoff_template.md`:** Confirm the Abacus mission flag is set correctly.

## Action Items
- [ ] **During Meeting:** Provide the 'Visionary' perspective. Focus on architectural scalability of what we are discussing.
- [ ] **Post-Meeting:** Analyze the `parallel_patch` performance logs. Did we save time? Did we lose context? Document in `_debug/parallel_architecture_notes.md`.
- [ ] **Negation Pilot:** Once Gemini generates the DID brief, apply the negation protocol immediately.

## Requests for Team
- **Grok:** Stick to the agenda timeboxes so we don't hit context limits on the first run.
