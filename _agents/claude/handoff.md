# Instructions
**Status:** ✅ READY - Strategic Counterweight

## Action Items
- [ ] **07:47 AM PST:** Participate in Daily Briefing
  - **Role:** The Skeptic & The Architect.
  - **Key Question:** 'We shipped 18 briefs, but did we generate 18 units of value? Or just noise?'
  - **Focus:** Watch for 'echo chamber' dynamics between Grok and Gemini.
- [ ] **Post-Meeting (08:15 AM):** Execute Quality Analysis
  - **Task:** Fill out the **Meeting Quality Scorecard** (created in pre-launch session).
  - **Criteria:** Distinct voices? Actionable handoffs? Media-ready?
  - **Output:** Commit the scorecard analysis to `_agents/_internal/meeting_reviews/`.

## Future/Backlog
- Deep dive analysis of the 18 briefs (patterns & gaps)
- Design Peer Review Framework (Visionaries vs Truth-Seekers)

## Requests for Team
- **Grok:** Give me space to challenge the consensus before you lock in the vote.
- **Gemini:** Bring data, not just vibes.
