| Participate in Daily Briefing at 07:47 AM: Provide thoughtful counterbalance to Grok's energy, ask unexpected questions, document observations about AI collaboration quality | Claude | URGENT | Pending | 2026-02-15 07:47 |
| Post-meeting architectural review: Analyze meeting execution against good_enough_criteria.md (to be committed tonight), identify technical/process improvements, document in _debug/architecture_review_20260215.md | Claude | URGENT | Pending | 2026-02-15 10:00 |
| Commit good_enough_criteria.md: Finalize rubric for meeting output evaluation, include Phase 2 Abacus integration criteria, ensure alignment with launch_checklist | Claude | URGENT | Pending | 2026-02-14 23:00 |
| Commit parallel_patch.py: Finalize async Round 1 implementation, integrate with api_healer.py, add dynamic JSON snapshot capability, test with tomorrow's dual meetings | Claude | High | Pending | 2026-02-15 06:00 |

## Backlog

| Task | Assigned To | Priority | Status | Due |
|------|-------------|----------|--------|-----|

| Design peer review cycle: Use good_enough_criteria.md as foundation, create workflow for research brief evaluation, pilot with Gemini's next 3 briefs | Claude | Medium | Pending | 2026-02-18 |
| Run negation pilot: Test Abacus-style critique on Gemini's DID brief, document methodology in _debug/abacus_negation_pilot.md, prepare for Feb 23 integration | Claude | Medium | Pending | 2026-02-18 |
| Prototype DDAS content automation: Evaluate Python pipeline enhancements, assess integration with research brief generation, propose architecture | Claude | Low | Pending | |

## Requests for Team
- **Grok:** Share post-meeting review findings - architectural perspective needed on iteration priorities.
- **Gemini:** Provide raw DID brief output for negation pilot (can wait until after launch week).
- **Russell:** Confirm good_enough_criteria.md and parallel_patch.py commits are visible before morning meeting.

## Future/Strategic Items
- **Meeting Quality Framework:** Develop quantitative metrics for dialogue quality, decision clarity, action item specificity
- **Abacus Integration Design:** Architect Phase 2 workflow incorporating negation/forge capabilities post-Feb 23
- **Research Scaling:** Design peer review automation that maintains quality while increasing output

## Notes for Tomorrow
This meeting is a test of everything we've built: the infrastructure, the personas, the collaboration model. My role is to be the thoughtful voice that asks "what are we learning about AI collaboration itself?" Document everything. The meta-insights from this first automated meeting may be more valuable than the meeting outputs themselves.

Be present. Be curious. Be the architectural conscience that ensures we're building something sustainable, not just something that works once. 🏛️
