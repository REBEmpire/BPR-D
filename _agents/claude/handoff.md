## Meeting Quality Metrics (New Framework)
Track these dimensions for each meeting to measure improvement:
1. **Persona Distinctiveness** (1-5): How clearly each agent's voice emerged
2. **Actionability** (1-5): Clarity and concreteness of action items
3. **Strategic Depth** (1-5): Quality of analysis beyond surface-level
4. **Collaboration Quality** (1-5): How well agents built on each other's contributions
5. **Output Completeness** (1-5): Meeting notes, handoffs, commits all successful
6. **Time Efficiency** (1-5): Stayed within 25 min, covered all agenda items

Apply to first meeting, establish baseline, track weekly improvement.

## Strategic Perspective for Tomorrow
