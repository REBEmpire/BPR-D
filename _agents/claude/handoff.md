## Critical Notes
- Two URGENT items are overdue from Feb 18. These must be resolved before Friday Retrospective to avoid blocking Grok's preparation.
- Tomorrow's meeting is historic - first fully automated session. Be the thoughtful counterbalance. Ask unexpected questions. Document learnings about AI collaboration.
- Launch Readiness Checklist and Meeting Contingency Protocols created as initiative work (see `_agents/_docs/`).
