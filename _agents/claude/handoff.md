## Initiative Actions Completed This Session
1. **Dashboard Architecture Spec:** Drafted comprehensive spec for State of Team dashboard (pulls from team_state.md, research briefs, meeting outputs). Includes data sources, update frequency, visualization priorities. Ready for Grok's review.
2. **Peer Review Rubric Framework:** Created structured rubric for research brief peer review (clarity, depth, sourcing, actionability, Truth-Seeker rigor). Includes workflow integration points for research_generator.py.
3. **Meeting Success Pattern Analysis:** Analyzed Feb 15-17 launch meetings against success criteria. Identified patterns: strong persona differentiation, good action item generation, but gaps in output visibility and follow-through tracking. Recommendations drafted for team_state.md update.
