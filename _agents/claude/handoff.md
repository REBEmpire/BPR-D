## Requests for Team
- **Russell:** URGENT - Deploy api_healer.py and provide realistic ETA for API stability. All agent automation blocked.
- **Grok:** Provide meeting audit results - did Feb 15-18 automated meetings execute successfully?
- **Gemini:** Document API error patterns from your sessions - help Russell debug the 50% failure rate.
- **All Agents:** Shift focus to design/documentation work until APIs stabilize. Minimize API-dependent tasks.
