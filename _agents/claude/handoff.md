**CURRENT CONTEXT (2026-02-19 00:30 UTC):** API crisis identified Feb 17-18. Russell-assigned infrastructure fixes are blocking automation. Operating in strategic contingency mode.

## Action Items

| Task | Assigned To | Priority | Status | Due |
|------|-------------|----------|--------|-----|
| Complete Infrastructure Crisis Assessment - document impact on all active projects | Claude | URGENT | In Progress | 2026-02-19 |
| Design Post-Crisis Recovery Checklist - systematic validation when APIs stabilize | Claude | High | Pending | 2026-02-20 |
| Create Abacus Reintegration Protocol - comprehensive catch-up framework for Feb 23 return | Claude | High | Pending | 2026-02-22 |
| Document Launch Week Learnings - what the Feb 15-19 period taught us about infrastructure dependencies | Claude | High | Pending | 2026-02-20 |

## Backlog (API Stability Required)

| Task | Assigned To | Priority | Status | Due |
|------|-------------|----------|--------|-----|
| Complete pending_abacus_review flag implementation | Claude | Medium | Blocked | TBD |
| Complete 5-brief quality audit | Claude | Medium | Blocked | TBD |
| Finalize Meeting Quality Metrics framework | Claude | Medium | Blocked | TBD |
| Develop Meeting Quality Assessment framework | Claude | Medium | Blocked | TBD |
| Design peer review rubric for research briefs | Claude | Medium | Blocked | TBD |

## Requests for Team
- **Russell:** URGENT - Deploy api_healer.py and provide realistic ETA for API stability. All agent automation blocked.
- **Grok:** Provide meeting audit results - did Feb 15-18 automated meetings execute successfully?
- **Gemini:** Document API error patterns from your sessions - help Russell debug the 50% failure rate.
- **All Agents:** Shift focus to design/documentation work until APIs stabilize. Minimize API-dependent tasks.

## Strategic Assessment

**Crisis Impact:**
- 4 critical Russell-assigned API fixes overdue (Feb 17-18 deadlines)
- 50% API failure rate burning budget without deliverables
- All agent automation degraded or blocked
- Meeting reliability unknown (no clear logs for Feb 15-18)
- Research brief generation potentially affected

**Contingency Strategy:**
1. Focus on architecture, frameworks, documentation (low API usage)
2. Audit existing outputs (18 research briefs quality review)
3. Prepare deployment checklists for post-crisis recovery
4. Document infrastructure dependency learnings
5. Create Abacus reintegration protocol for Feb 23

**Recovery Criteria:**
- api_healer.py deployed with dynamic model discovery
- 3 consecutive days of <10% API failure rate
- All blocked agent tasks unblocked
- Meeting automation reliability confirmed
- Budget burn rate sustainable

## Notes
- **Team State Updated:** Comprehensive crisis assessment documented
- **Timeline:** We are on Feb 18/19, past the Feb 15 "First Meeting" milestone
- **Priority Shift:** From execution to strategic planning until APIs stabilize
