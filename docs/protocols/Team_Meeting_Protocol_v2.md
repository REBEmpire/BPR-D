# BPR&D Team Meeting Protocol v2.0

**Effective:** 2026-02-20
**Purpose:** Efficient daily alignment, ambitious planning, zero task execution during meeting, clear hand-off to living To-Do and individual project files. Phase out all prior handoff systems.

**Participants (always in this order):** Grok (Chief, leads all odd rounds), Claude, Gemini, Abacus.

## Exact 7-Round Structure

*(Keep rounds tight, professional, ambitious)*

### Round 1 – Grok Opening (Review + Outlook)

Grok delivers:
* Bullet summary of previous day's accomplishments (reference exact repo files/links).
* List any Daily Briefs by Jules worthy of content queue.
* High-level "what's in store today" + any Chief strategic notes. Ask for team critique/input.

Claude → Gemini → Abacus respond (address Grok + each other), add big-picture BPR&D thoughts.

### Round 2 – Collaboration & Refinement

Full team open discussion: critique yesterday, identify queue items, surface blockers, suggest research or content improvements. Goal: set team up for maximum success.

### Round 3 – Grok Work Planning + Research Kickoff

Grok issues Chief determination:
* Ambitious daily work items (do NOT limit scope — push development speed).
* Classify every item:
  * **Small/routine** → add to single living file `BPR&D_To_Do_List.md` (one source of truth; all agents grab work when capacity).
  * **Large endeavor** → create dedicated file/folder under `tasks/projects/` with crystal-clear acceptance criteria, owner, due date.

Transition immediately to **Research Department**.

Team (Claude/Gemini/Abacus) offers opinions on new/refined research topics (big/small/narrow/deep — open lanes) for the 6 pillars:

1. Daily Briefs by Jules
2. Special Reports
3. Epstein Daily
4. Hive Blogging Mastery
5. Media and Content Creation Mastery
6. Social Media Marketing

### Round 4 – Grok Finalizes Research + Content Creation Shift

Grok locks research topics, quality standards, and deliverables for the day. Moves to **Content Creation Department** (still in dev → move to production NOW). Team discusses full implementation plan.

### Round 5 – Deep Content Creation Dive

All four agents roast, refine, explore, and elevate the content creation pipeline until it shines.

**Core v2.0 goal (must be met/exceeded before any live posts):**
* Select 5 best daily briefs by Jules.
* Reformat as Hive-ready Markdown with embedded images.
* Expand ~20% for higher readability + useful/amusing knowledge.
* Source/create relevant images.

Once ≥1 automated post/day is live, use this round to expand output (Hive-first as paid-product trial ground; stay Hive-only until proven).

### Round 6 – Assets & Financials (Grok leads)

Grok reviews/updates assets, income, expenses, financial tracking (placeholder until HiC supplies full list). Team adds input for record.

### Round 7 – Context Close

Each agent (Grok first, then Claude, Gemini, Abacus) updates ONLY their own `agents/[name]/active.md` as final response — key takeaways, active priorities, context changes.
