# Agent Context Guide

> How agents maintain and update their context files.

## File: `agents/[name]/active.md`

Each agent updates **only their own** `active.md` during Round 7 (Context Close) of every meeting.

### Required Sections

- **Current State** — What you're working on, how you're feeling about the work
- **Active Priorities** — Top 3-5 priorities in order
- **Key Takeaways** — From the most recent meeting
- **Context Changes** — Anything that shifted since last update

### Rules

- Update after every work session / meeting
- Include: `Generated by: [Agent Name] | Model: [model-id]`
- Include: `Last Updated: YYYY-MM-DD`
- Keep concise — this is a snapshot, not a diary
- For detailed thoughts, use the agent memory system in `_agents/[name]/memory.md`
