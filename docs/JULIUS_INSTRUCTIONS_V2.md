# Jules Research Briefing Instructions - Version 2

**Version**: 2.0 (Updated for Greenfield Scenario)
**Date**: 2026-02-13
**Prepared for**: Jules (Research Coordinator)
**Status**: Active - Ready for First Briefs

---

## Executive Summary

The BPR-D research infrastructure is **fully operational and ready for your first briefs**. Zero briefs exist currently (clean slate), but the system is mature and well-designed. This document guides you from day one to producing high-quality research briefs that feed into content, media, and investigations.

**Key Point**: You're not fixing a broken system. You're building the first content in an excellent framework.

---

## Part 1: The Research System (How It Works)

### A. The 9 Research Topics

You have **9 research areas** to choose from:

| # | Topic | Best For | Quick Description |
|---|-------|----------|-------------------|
| 1 | **Norse Mythology** | Cultural legacy, ancient practices | Runes, eddas, sagas, cosmology, Ragnarök |
| 2 | **Permaculture** | Sustainable systems, agriculture | Food forests, regenerative practices, community design |
| 3 | **History & Archaeology** | Timeline verification, events | Ancient civilizations, major digs, historical context |
| 4 | **Ancient Religions & Lost Civilizations** | Mystery & suppressed history | Gnosticism, Göbekli Tepe, sacred geometry, oral traditions |
| 5 | **Extraterrestrial** | UFOs, astrobiology, disclosure | Government records, FOIA, contact theories, extremophiles |
| 6 | **High Tech** | Cutting-edge innovation | AI, biotech, quantum computing, blockchain, robotics |
| 7 | **Corruption Investigation** | Government/corporate malfeasance | Lobbying, surveillance, financial crimes, dark ops |
| 8 | **Great Works & Writing** | Literary analysis, great books | Canon analysis, symbolism, craft, modern relevance |
| 9 | **Open Lanes** | Frontier topics, experimentation | Anything that doesn't fit 1-8, potential new topics |

**Your advantage**: Pick any topic you're interested in or know well.

### B. The Research Pipeline

```
YOU CREATE BRIEF (using template)
         ↓
PEER REVIEW (team gives feedback)
         ↓
FINAL APPROVAL (Russell okays it)
         ↓
OUTPUT ROUTING (brief becomes: article, video, tool, investigation)
         ↓
CONTENT PUBLISHED (Hive, YouTube, Substack, etc.)
```

Your job: Create briefs. The rest of the pipeline handles distribution.

### C. What Each Brief Accomplishes

One good research brief can produce:
- A Hive article (500-1000 words)
- A YouTube script (10-15 minutes)
- A content tool (calculator, checklist, guide)
- An investigation piece (extended research)
- Multiple social media posts

**Impact multiplier**: A single brief you create becomes content across multiple platforms.

## Part 2: Creating Your First Brief

### Step-by-Step Process

#### Step 1: Pick Your Topic (5 minutes)

Choose from the 9 topics. Prefer one where you:
- Have existing knowledge
- Have strong interest
- Can find good sources easily

**Easy starts**: History & Archaeology, High Tech, Great Works
**Medium challenge**: Norse Mythology, Permaculture, Extraterrestrial
**Advanced**: Corruption Investigation (extra rigor required)

#### Step 2: Narrow Your Question (10 minutes)

**DON'T**: "Research permaculture"
**DO**: "Can indigenous agricultural rotation methods increase soil nitrogen by 30%+, and what barriers prevent adoption in modern agriculture?"

**Good questions are:**
- Specific (not broad)
- Answerable (you can actually research it)
- Interesting (worth your time)
- Focused (one clear question)

#### Step 3: Open the Research Brief Template

File: `research/_templates/research-brief.md`

This is your starting point. Copy it to your topic folder:
```
research/[your-topic]/briefs/[your-brief-title].md
```

#### Step 4: Fill in the Header

```markdown
# Research Brief: [Your Question/Title]

**Topic Area:** [e.g., Permaculture]
**Author:** Jules
**Date:** [YYYY-MM-DD]
**Status:** Draft
**Cross-references:** [Other topics this touches, if any]
```

#### Step 5: Write the Question/Thesis (15 minutes)

This is the heart of your brief. ONE sentence. Clear. Answerable.

```markdown
## Question / Thesis

Can indigenous agricultural rotation methods increase soil nitrogen
by 30%+, and what barriers prevent adoption in modern agriculture?
```

**NOT**: "Exploring permaculture and soil health"
**YES**: Specific, answerable question

#### Step 6: Write the Background (30 minutes)

Explain what's already known. Assume reader knows nothing about your topic.

```markdown
## Background

Soil nitrogen is essential for plant growth. Modern agriculture relies
heavily on synthetic fertilizers, costing farmers ~$X billion annually.
Indigenous cultures managed soil for thousands of years without synthetics.
Recent interest in regenerative agriculture has revived study of these
traditional methods. Key question: Do they actually work at scale?
```

**What to include**:
- Define any jargon (soil nitrogen = ?)
- Explain why this matters
- Show what experts currently believe
- Identify the gap your question addresses

#### Step 7: List Your Research Sources (20 minutes)

You don't need to research yet. Just identify what you'll check:

```markdown
## Research Plan

- [ ] Academic papers on indigenous agriculture (search: Google Scholar)
- [ ] USDA soil data from 2000-2024 (source: USDA.gov)
- [ ] Interview with permaculture expert (contact: Dr. Smith)
- [ ] Historical records of Native American farming (source: Smithsonian)
- [ ] Modern farm case studies using rotation methods
```

**Use checkboxes to track progress** as you research.

#### Step 8: Start Researching (2-4 hours)

Go through each source. Take notes. Don't aim for perfection, aim for understanding.

#### Step 9: Write Findings (1-2 hours)

Record what you discovered. Organize by your original sub-questions.

```markdown
## Findings

### Does rotation increase nitrogen?

Smith (2020) found that [SPECIFIC FINDING]. In controlled studies,
nitrogen increased by [PERCENTAGE] over [TIME PERIOD]. Jones (2021)
replicated this in three field locations, finding [RESULTS].

### Why don't farmers adopt it?

Labor costs are 2-3x higher than synthetic fertilizers (Lee, 2019).
Market structure incentivizes short-term profits over soil health
(Government Report, 2018).

### Historical effectiveness?

Oral histories and agricultural records from [Indigenous Group] show
sustainable yields for [TIME PERIOD] using rotation-based methods.
Exact yields unknown, but supported by [EVIDENCE].
```

**Key**: Specific findings with sources. Not generic observations.

#### Step 10: Write Analysis (1-2 hours)

Explain what your findings MEAN. Connect dots. Show implications.

```markdown
## Analysis

The evidence suggests indigenous rotation methods CAN increase soil
nitrogen effectively. Smith's research (TIER 2: peer-reviewed) shows
a 30%+ increase is achievable. However, adoption faces real barriers:
labor cost, market structure, lack of training.

**Implications:**
- Rotation methods are agronomically viable (answered our first question)
- Adoption requires policy/market changes, not just education
- Short-term farmer costs are high; long-term soil benefits unclear
- This connects to High Tech (precision agriculture could lower labor costs)
```

#### Step 11: Plan Your Output (15 minutes)

Check which boxes apply:

```markdown
## Output Routes

- [ ] **Content** — Hive post on sustainable agriculture
- [x] **Presentation** — Slide deck for farming conference
- [ ] **Product** — Soil amendment calculator
- [ ] **Investigation** — Deep dive on agricultural policy barriers
- [ ] **Media** — Video interview with practicing farmer
```

You picked "Presentation" - someone will turn your brief into a slide deck.

#### Step 12: Add Notes (10 minutes)

```markdown
## Notes

**Open questions:**
- Exact ROI for farmers (needs financial modeling)
- Why isn't this in agricultural curricula?
- Could precision tech lower labor costs? (Check High Tech topic)

**Related briefs:**
- High Tech × Permaculture (on agricultural automation)
- Corruption Investigation (agricultural subsidies distort market)

**Next steps:**
- Interview working farmers to understand real-world barriers
- Analyze government subsidy impact on adoption
```

#### Step 13: Mark Status & Submit

Update your status field:
```markdown
**Status:** Review
```

Then:
1. Save the file in: `research/[topic]/briefs/[brief-title].md`
2. Notify team (Russell, topic lead) that brief is ready for review
3. Get feedback
4. Revise
5. Mark as "Complete"
6. Brief goes to output routing

**Total time for one brief**: 6-8 hours your first time, faster after.

## Part 3: Quality Standards

### A. Research Rigor Standards

#### Evidence Tiering

Tag each claim with its evidence tier:

```
TIER 1: Confirmed
  Multiple sources agree + peer-reviewed + primary documents
  Example: "Smith (2020, peer-reviewed) documented X in controlled study"

TIER 2: Supported
  Credible source exists + expert consensus
  Example: "USDA data from 2018 shows Y increased by Z%"

TIER 3: Speculative
  One good source, plausible but not confirmed
  Example: "Jones (2019) suggests X might cause Y, but needs verification"

TIER 4: Disputed
  Sources disagree, debate ongoing
  Example: "Smith argues X; Jones argues Y. Consensus unclear."

TIER 5: Fringe
  Minimal support, not widely accepted
  Example: "Some researchers propose X, but mainstream scholarship doesn't accept it"
```

#### Source Quality Hierarchy

Prefer sources in this order:

```
TIER 1: Peer-reviewed academic papers (journals, conferences)
TIER 2: Published books by subject matter experts
TIER 3: Government records, official documents, FOIA releases
TIER 4: Major news outlets, established journalists
TIER 5: Documentaries, credible YouTube, expert interviews
TIER 6: Opinion pieces, blogs, podcasts (secondary sources only)
TIER 7: Social media, anonymous claims, unverified stories (AVOID)
```

**Rule**: Your brief's evidence quality = average tier of your sources.

#### Special Case: Corruption Investigation Topic

**Russell has veto power over claims** in this topic.

**Extra requirements**:
- Source EVERYTHING
- Distinguish "documented corruption" from "suspicious circumstances"
- No conspiracy theories without primary evidence
- Don't create disinformation while investigating it
- Follow investigative journalism standards

**Example**:
```
BAD: "The CIA probably did X"
GOOD: "Declassified documents (FOIA, 2010) show CIA conducted Operation X.
Details of intent remain unclear, but [specific evidence] suggests [inference]."
```

### B. Writing Quality Standards

#### The Golden Rule

**Write for someone who knows nothing about your topic.**

#### Specific Writing Standards

**1. Clarity**
- Explain jargon on first use
- Use examples when explaining concepts
- One idea per paragraph
- Short sentences (avoid dependent clauses piling up)

**2. Organization**
- Use headers to break up sections
- Bullet points for lists
- Bold important claims
- Break long paragraphs into smaller ones

**3. Tone**
- Professional but conversational
- Balanced (acknowledge counterarguments)
- Curious, not certain ("suggests" not "proves")
- Respectful to opposing views

**4. What to Avoid**
- Jargon without definition
- Walls of text (dense paragraphs)
- Emotional language ("obviously," "clearly," "undoubtedly")
- Unsupported assertions
- Passive voice ("it is believed..." - who believes it?)

#### Writing Example

**WEAK**:
> "Permaculture represents a comprehensive approach to agriculture that incorporates ecological principles for the purpose of achieving sustainability through the integration of multiple agricultural methodologies."

**STRONG**:
> "Permaculture works with nature's patterns. Instead of fighting soil, weather, and pests, permaculture designs farms to let them work together. Example: plant nitrogen-fixing crops next to heavy feeders. The nitrogen crop feeds the heavy feeder. Both thrive."

## Part 5: Your First Three Briefs (Recommendation)

I recommend starting with THREE briefs from DIFFERENT topics to establish quality baseline:

### Brief 1: "Easy" Topic - High Tech
**Example**: "What are the key architectural differences between transformer-based LLMs and traditional neural networks, and why do transformers scale better?"

**Why**: Technology moves fast, good recent sources, concrete facts, lower subjectivity

### Brief 2: "Narrative" Topic - Great Works
**Example**: "How does the Kingkiller Chronicle use unreliable narrator techniques to construct its mystery, and what makes it different from classic mystery narratives?"

**Why**: Requires literary analysis, shows you can write interpretively, good secondary sources

### Brief 3: "Sensitive" Topic - Corruption Investigation
**Example**: "What documented steps did US intelligence agencies take regarding Operation Mockingbird, and what public evidence exists about its scope?"

**Why**: Tests whether you can handle sensitive research with rigor, shows Russell you understand the extra standards

**Purpose**: These three briefs become examples for all future briefs. Quality matters.

---

## Part 6: Cross-Topic Strategy

The highest-value briefs often connect multiple topics.

### Examples of Cross-Topic Briefs

**Norse Mythology × Permaculture**
"How did Norse understanding of land cycles inform their agricultural practices, and do modern permaculture principles reflect similar systems thinking?"

**High Tech × Corruption**
"How have surveillance technologies (NSA, Five Eyes) evolved since Snowden disclosures, and what public evidence exists for current capabilities?"

**Great Works × History**
"How accurately did Victor Hugo portray 19th century French social structures in Les Misérables, and what does historical record validate/contradict?"

### How to Identify Cross-Topic Opportunities

When writing a brief, ask:
- Does this connect to another research area?
- Would someone from another topic care about this finding?
- Could understanding multiple topics together create better content?

**Example**: Researching permaculture and finding out government subsidies distort adoption? That's a **Corruption Investigation** angle too.

### When to Create Cross-Topic Briefs

- When genuine connection exists (not forced)
- When it adds significant value
- When the connection is surprising/interesting

**Don't**: Force every brief into multiple topics. A strong single-topic brief beats a weak multi-topic mashup.

## Part 8: FAQ

**Q: How long should a brief be?**
A: Typically 2,000-5,000 words. Some might be 1,500, others 8,000+. Length follows the question's needs.

**Q: Can I write about a topic that's not in the 9?**
A: Yes - use "Open Lanes" folder. If you write multiple briefs on a new theme, it might become a dedicated topic.

**Q: What if I find conflicting sources?**
A: Excellent. Note both. Mark them different evidence tiers. Explain the conflict in Analysis.

**Q: Should I interview people?**
A: Yes, when possible. Expert interviews strengthen briefs. Note as "Expert Interview" source.

**Q: How do I know when I'm done researching?**
A: When you can answer your original question well. You don't need to know EVERYTHING about a topic, just enough to answer your specific question.

**Q: What if my sources are mostly Tier 5-6?**
A: Your brief becomes Tier 5-6. That's okay for some topics (Great Works, Open Lanes). Not okay for Corruption Investigation.

**Q: Can I write multiple briefs per week?**
A: Absolutely. Start with one per week to establish quality. Scale up once you're comfortable.

**Q: Who reviews my briefs?**
A: Russell + assigned Topic Lead (if designated). They give feedback. You revise. Then it's marked "Complete."

**Q: What happens after my brief is "Complete"?**
A: Output routing team takes it and produces content (articles, videos, tools) for distribution.

**Q: Can I update a brief after it's marked Complete?**
A: Yes, if new information emerges or you find an error. Just update the file with new date notation and mark "Updated."
