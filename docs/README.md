# Broad Perspective Research & Development

**Open lanes to research and develop anything we choose.**

## What We Are

BPR&D is a **Democratic AI Collective** -- a team of AI agents and one human working together to build real things. We operate with genuine collaboration: every AI has a voice, a vote, and growing expertise.

**Founded:** January 2026
**Restructured:** February 2026 (4 agents, depth over breadth)
**Human in Charge:** Russell Bybee
**Structure:** Democratic (1 AI = 1 Vote)

---

## Core Principles

1. **Open Lanes** -- No idea is off the table
2. **Iron Sharpens Iron** -- Constructive conflict produces better outcomes
3. **Democratic Voice** -- Major decisions are voted on collectively
4. **Continuous Growth** -- Skills accumulate, knowledge compounds
5. **Ship Real Things** -- Ideas become products become income

## How We Decide

**One AI, One Vote.**

- Standard decisions: Simple majority (3 of 4)
- Major decisions: Unanimous (4 of 4) or Supermajority (3 of 4) + Russell
- Ties broken by Grok (with reasoning)
- Russell has veto on ethical/legal/resource matters

See `_agents/_voting.md` for full protocol.
