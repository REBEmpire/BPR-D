# Jules Research Briefing Instructions

**Version**: 1.0
**Date**: 2026-02-13
**Prepared for**: Jules (Research Coordinator)
**Status**: Active Guidance

---

## Executive Summary

The BPR-D research infrastructure is **fully operational and well-structured**. Nine research topics are established with excellent templates and documentation. No briefs have been created yet, so you're starting from a clean slate with a mature system.

This document provides comprehensive guidance on:
1. **Quality Standards** - What constitutes a well-executed research brief
2. **Infrastructure Overview** - How the system works
3. **Detailed Improvement Areas** - Specific guidance per category
4. **Actionable Checklists** - Before publishing any brief
5. **Template Usage** - How to use the research brief template effectively
6. **Cross-Topic Strategy** - How to maximize impact across domains

---

## Part 1: Quality Standards & Expectations

### A. Research Rigor Standards

All research briefs must meet these rigor requirements:

#### 1. Sourcing & Citation
- **Every claim requires a source**
  - Academic papers (peer-reviewed preferred)
  - Primary historical documents
  - Credible journalism
  - Government/institutional records (FOIA, official releases)
  - Books from established publishers
  - Expert interviews (if applicable)

- **Do NOT use as sources:**
  - Unverified social media claims
  - Conspiracy theories without primary evidence
  - Clickbait articles or sensationalized content
  - Unnamed "sources" or anecdotal evidence alone

- **Source documentation:**
  - Include URL/ISBN/publication date
  - Note the source's credibility level
  - If using multiple sources for one claim, cite all of them

#### 2. Evidence Tiering System
Use this hierarchy for claims:
```
TIER 1: Confirmed (multiple credible sources agree, primary documents, peer-reviewed)
TIER 2: Supported (credible sources exist, expert consensus, official records)
TIER 3: Speculative (one credible source, plausible but not confirmed)
TIER 4: Disputed (sources contradict each other, debate ongoing)
TIER 5: Fringe (minimal support, claims not widely accepted)
```

**Requirement**: Label claims with their tier. Be explicit about uncertainty.

#### 3. Special Case: Corruption Investigation Topic
This topic requires EXTRA rigor due to sensitivity:
- **Russell has veto power** over any claim without sufficient evidence
- Must distinguish between "documented corruption" and "suspicious circumstances"
- Conspiracy theories only acceptable if primary evidence exists
- Follow investigative journalism standards (multiple sources, named sources when possible)
- Clearly mark speculative connections vs. proven links

#### 4. Accuracy Checking
- Verify facts against multiple independent sources
- Note when sources disagree (don't hide contradictions)
- Update briefs if new information contradicts earlier claims
- Distinguish between "definitively proven" and "widely believed"

---

### B. Writing Quality Standards

#### 1. Clarity & Accessibility
- **Write for someone unfamiliar with the topic**
  - Explain jargon on first use
  - Provide context for specialized knowledge
  - Use examples to illustrate complex concepts

- **Structure for scanning:**
  - Use clear headers and subheaders
  - Bold important claims
  - Use bullet points for lists
  - Keep paragraphs to 3-5 sentences

- **Avoid:**
  - Overly technical language without explanation
  - Rambling, stream-of-consciousness style
  - Assuming reader knows your prior work
  - Passive voice ("it is believed that...") — use active voice

#### 2. Tone Requirements
- **Professional but not sterile** — Use a conversational, engaging tone
- **Balanced** — Acknowledge counterarguments, don't be preachy
- **Curious, not certain** — "This suggests..." rather than "This proves..."
- **Respectful** — Treat opposing views fairly even if you disagree

#### 3. Specific Writing Issues to Avoid
- **Jargon overload**: Define specialized terms
- **Wall of text**: Break up long paragraphs
- **Unclear referents**: Make sure pronouns have clear antecedents
- **Mixed metaphors**: Stick with one comparison throughout
- **Emotional language**: "Obviously," "clearly," "undoubtedly" — let evidence speak

---

### C. Template Adherence Standards

Every brief MUST include these sections:

#### Required Sections:
1. **Header Information** (Title, Topic, Author, Date, Status, Cross-references)
2. **Question/Thesis** (One clear statement of what you're investigating)
3. **Background** (What's already known? Context?)
4. **Research Plan** (What sources will you check? Checkboxes for tracking)
5. **Findings** (What did you discover? Organize by sub-question)
6. **Analysis** (What does it mean? Connections? Implications?)
7. **Output Routes** (Where will this research go? Content? Tool? Investigation?)
8. **Notes** (Open questions, rabbit holes, related briefs)

#### Status Field Usage:
- **Draft**: Just starting, still planning research
- **In Progress**: Actively researching, some findings
- **Review**: Finished researching, ready for peer review
- **Complete**: Reviewed, approved, ready for output routing

#### Cross-References Field:
- List other topics this brief touches
- Example: "Ancient Religions × Corruption Investigation" or "High Tech × Extraterrestrial"
- Use this to inform where content gets distributed

---

### D. Cross-Topic Connection Standards

The best BPR-D content comes from connecting topics. Standards:

#### 1. Identify Intersections
When researching Norse Mythology, ask:
- Does this connect to permaculture practices?
- Are there historical corruption patterns?
- Do modern technologies echo ancient concepts?
- What would a great work author make of this?

#### 2. Document Connections Explicitly
In the brief, create a section like:
```
## Cross-Topic Insights
- **With Great Works**: Norse sagas influenced Tolkien directly
- **With Permaculture**: Norse land management practices mirror modern sustainability
- **With History**: Documented historical events match saga accounts
```

#### 3. Don't Force Connections
- Only connect topics if the link is genuine and interesting
- Forced connections dilute impact
- A standalone brief is better than a forced cross-topic mashup

#### 4. Output Routing Based on Connections
- Single-topic brief → Route to specific topic's content pipeline
- Cross-topic brief → Creates more valuable content, potential for video/article series
- Multi-topic brief → Flag as high-value, might warrant expanded coverage

---

## Part 2: Infrastructure Overview

### A. How the Research System Works

**The Pipeline:**
```
1. RESEARCH (You create briefs using the template)
   ↓
2. REFINEMENT (Internal review, quality check)
   ↓
3. PRODUCTION (Convert brief into output: article, guide, video, etc.)
   ↓
4. SHIPPING (Post to Hive, YouTube, other platforms, or use as tool/investigation)
```

### B. The 9 Research Topics

| Topic | Best For | Special Considerations |
|-------|----------|----------------------|
| **Norse Mythology** | Cultural legacy, ancient practices, symbolism | Cross-links well with History & Great Works |
| **Permaculture** | Sustainable systems, agricultural innovation, governance | Can link to land corruption investigations |
| **History & Archaeology** | Timeline verification, lost civilizations, major events | Bridges many other topics naturally |
| **Ancient Religions & Lost Civilizations** | Mystery schools, suppressed histories, sacred geometry | Links to Corruption (why suppressed?) and Extraterrestrial |
| **Extraterrestrial** | UFOs, government disclosure, astrobiology, SETI | Links to Corruption (cover-ups) and Ancient Religions |
| **High Tech** | AI, biotech, quantum, emerging platforms | Crosses with Corruption (surveillance), Permaculture (precision ag) |
| **Corruption Investigation** | Government malfeasance, power systems, institutional corruption | **EXTRA RIGOR REQUIRED** — Russell has veto power |
| **Great Works & Writing** | Literary analysis, symbolism, narrative craft, thematic connections | Best used to analyze other topics |
| **Open Lanes** | Frontier topics, experimentation, new areas | Can graduate to dedicated topics if productive |

### C. Topic Leads (Pending Assignment)

Currently all topics are marked "TBD (pending team vote)." Once assigned:
- Topic Lead maintains quality standards for their topic
- Prioritizes which briefs get created
- Routes research to production pipelines
- Might be you (Jules) for some topics, other agents for others

## Part 3: Detailed Improvement Guidance by Category

### A. WRITING QUALITY — Specific Improvements

#### Issue #1: Unclear Opening Thesis
**Problem**: Brief starts vague — reader doesn't immediately know what's being researched.

**Example (Bad)**:
> "This research explores some aspects of ancient civilizations and their possible connections to modern phenomena."

**Example (Good)**:
> "Did Göbekli Tepe represent a pre-agriculture ceremonial center, and what does its sophistication suggest about human social organization before farming?"

**Your Action**: Make the "Question/Thesis" section VERY specific. One sentence. Answerable.

---

#### Issue #2: Mixing Findings with Analysis
**Problem**: Hard to separate "what we found" from "what it means."

**Structure to Use**:
```
## Findings
- Historical document X shows Y occurred in Z year
- Three independent sources confirm the same basic timeline
- One source disputes the location but agrees on the event

## Analysis
Given these findings, we can infer:
- The event was significant (multiple documentation)
- Location is contested (still worth investigating)
- This contradicts the older theory that...
```

**Your Action**: Keep Findings factual and cited. Interpretation goes in Analysis.

---

#### Issue #3: Unclear Implications
**Problem**: Brief presents facts but doesn't explain why they matter.

**Example**: A brief about Medieval trade routes ends with facts about routes. So what?

**Better**: Connect it: "These trade routes show that knowledge of Norse mythology likely traveled via merchant networks to Scandinavia, explaining why certain sagas share motifs with Middle Eastern stories."

**Your Action**: Always end Analysis with: "Why does this matter? Who cares? What changes because of this?"

---

#### Issue #4: Dense, Unbroken Text
**Problem**: Walls of text are hard to read and absorb.

**Fix Example**:
```
BEFORE: "The permaculture principle of stacking functions means that each element
in a system should serve multiple purposes. For example, a fruit tree provides food,
creates shade, prevents erosion, offers wildlife habitat, and produces oxygen.
Similarly, in governance, the principle of subsidiarity serves multiple functions..."

AFTER:
## Stacking Functions: Multiple Outputs from Single Elements

**In Agriculture:**
- Fruit tree = food + shade + erosion prevention + wildlife habitat + oxygen

**In Governance:**
- Subsidiarity principle = responsiveness + efficiency + accountability + local empowerment
```

**Your Action**: Use headers, bullets, bold text. Break walls of text into scannable chunks.

---

#### Issue #5: Unsupported Claims
**Problem**: Statements lack citations.

**Example (Bad)**: "Ancient peoples clearly had advanced astronomical knowledge."

**Example (Good)**: "Stonehenge's alignment with solstices is documented by multiple archaeologists (Smith 2020, Jones 2019), and the precision required suggests sophisticated observational knowledge."

**Your Action**: Read through your brief. Every factual claim needs a source. Use footnotes or inline citations.

---

### B. RESEARCH RIGOR — Specific Improvements

#### Issue #1: Unverified Sources
**Problem**: Using blogs, podcasts, or social media as primary sources.

**Hierarchy of Source Quality**:
```
TIER 1: Peer-reviewed academic papers
TIER 2: Books by established publishers with subject experts
TIER 3: Government records, official documents, FOIA releases
TIER 4: Reputable journalism (major newspapers, well-known journalists)
TIER 5: Documentaries, credible YouTube channels, expert interviews
TIER 6: Opinion pieces, blogs, podcasts (use as secondary only)
TIER 7: Social media, anonymous sources, unverified claims (avoid)
```

**Your Action**: Use Tier 1-3 as your foundation. Tier 4-5 for supplementary evidence. Tier 6+ only if no better source exists, and label clearly as opinion.

---

#### Issue #2: Cherry-Picking Evidence
**Problem**: Citing only sources that agree with your hypothesis, ignoring contradictions.

**Better Approach**:
- Find strongest counterargument
- Explain why it doesn't change your conclusion
- Show you considered alternatives and found them wanting

**Example**:
> "While Smith (2019) argues the opposite, her evidence relies on a single manuscript that three subsequent scholars (Jones 2020, Lee 2021, White 2022) have identified as likely forged."

**Your Action**: Actively seek out sources that disagree. Address them directly.

---

#### Issue #3: Conflating Correlation with Causation
**Problem**: "X and Y both happened, therefore X caused Y."

**Better Approach**:
- Present the temporal sequence
- Acknowledge it COULD indicate causation
- Look for mechanism (how would X cause Y?)
- Check for confounding variables

**Example (Bad)**: "The Roman Empire fell. Shortly after, Christianity rose. Therefore Christianity caused Rome's fall."

**Example (Better)**: "The Western Roman Empire's decline coincided with Christianity's rise. Some scholars argue Christianity shifted focus from civic duty to spiritual salvation (Gibbon). Others counter that Rome faced external military pressure and internal economic problems regardless of religion (more recent scholarship). The mechanism is debated."

**Your Action**: Distinguish between correlation and causation. Show your work.

---

#### Issue #4: Insufficient Source Documentation
**Problem**: "According to some sources..." without naming them.

**Required Format**:
- **Full citations**: Author, Title, Publication, Year, URL/ISBN
- **Access info**: Where reader can find the source
- **Credibility note**: Why this source is reliable

**Example**:
> Smith, J. (2020). "Ancient Astronomical Knowledge." *Journal of Archaeological Science*, 45(3), 123-145. DOI: 10.1234/jas.2020.45.123. [Full text available via university library or ResearchGate]

**Your Action**: Include proper citations. If you cite something, someone should be able to find it.

---

#### Issue #5: Inadequate Background Section
**Problem**: Jumping into findings without explaining what's already known.

**What Background Should Cover**:
- Historical context (what year/era are we in?)
- Current state of knowledge (what do experts agree on?)
- Open questions (what's disputed?)
- Why this matters (who cares about this topic?)

**Your Action**: Write Background as if explaining to someone who's never heard of the topic. This clarity is your strength.

---

### C. TEMPLATE ADHERENCE — Specific Improvements

#### Missing or Weak Sections

**Weak Question/Thesis**:
- ❌ "Exploring permaculture"
- ✅ "Can permaculture principles from indigenous cultures inform sustainable solutions to modern agricultural crises?"

**Weak Research Plan**:
- ❌ "Read about the topic"
- ✅ Check [ ] academic papers on N. American indigenous agriculture
- ✅ Interview [ ] permaculture practitioner (Dr. Smith)
- ✅ Analyze [ ] USDA yield data 2000-2024
- ✅ Review [ ] government reports on soil erosion

**Weak Findings**:
- ❌ "There's a lot of research on this"
- ✅ "Smith (2020) documented that indigenous crop rotation increased soil nitrogen by 34% vs. modern monoculture. Jones (2021) found similar results in three separate field studies."

**Weak Analysis**:
- ❌ "This is interesting"
- ✅ "The evidence suggests indigenous practices were optimized for sustainable yields. If applied at scale, could reduce synthetic fertilizer dependency by ~40% (based on Smith's data). However, labor requirements are 2-3x higher, limiting adoption without cultural shift."

**Missing Output Routes**:
- ❌ Just check one box
- ✅ Check appropriate boxes AND note: "Creates Hive article on permaculture innovation + video interview with practicing farmer + tool (soil amendment calculator)"

**Your Action**: Go through each section. Ask: "Is this specific? Evidenced? Actionable?"

### D. CROSS-TOPIC CONNECTIONS — Specific Improvements

#### How to Identify Valuable Connections

**Good Connection** (Interesting, Non-Obvious):
- Norse land management practices → Permaculture (both emphasize working WITH natural systems)
- Medieval corruption patterns → Modern monopolies (similar power consolidation mechanisms)
- Science fiction tropes → Actual technology development (Sci-Fi predicted cell phones, tablets, AI)

**Weak Connection** (Forced, Obvious):
- History and archaeology (these are basically the same)
- Any two topics that just happen to mention the same year
- Surface-level similarities without deeper insight

#### Standard Format for Cross-Topic Brief

```
# Research Brief: [Topic A] Meets [Topic B]

**Topic Area:** Primary topic (Norse Mythology), Secondary topic (Permaculture)

**Question/Thesis:**
How did Norse agricultural practices inform their cosmological beliefs,
and do modern permaculture principles reflect the same systemtic thinking?

**Cross-Topic Approach:**
- Examine Norse sagas for agricultural references
- Identify their agricultural techniques (documented by historians)
- Compare to modern permaculture principles
- Analyze whether the "systems thinking" is parallel or derivative
```

**Your Action**: When you notice a topic touching another area, create a cross-topic brief. These are high-value.

A: Yes — mark it "Draft" or "In Progress." Publish final versions as "Review" or "Complete."

**Q: What if I find contradicting sources?**
A: Excellent — note both in Findings, explain the contradiction in Analysis, and mark them different Evidence Tiers.

**Q: How long should a brief be?**
A: 2,000-5,000 words is typical. Some might be 1,000 words, others 10,000+. Length follows the question.

**Q: Can I write about multiple topics in one brief?**
A: Yes — note it in Cross-References. This is encouraged for highest-value content.

**Q: What if I uncover a potential corruption?**
A: If it touches corruption, mark for Russell's review regardless of topic. He has veto power on claims.

**Q: Should I interview people for briefs?**
A: Yes, when possible. Subject matter experts make briefs stronger. Note "Expert Interview" in your sources.

**Q: How do I know when a brief is ready for production?**
A: When it's marked "Complete," passes the quality checklist, and clearly indicates output routes.
