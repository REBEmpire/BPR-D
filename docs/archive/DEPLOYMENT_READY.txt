================================================================================
HOW IT WORKS
================================================================================

WEEKLY CYCLE (Per Agent - 75 minutes/week)
  Sunday EOD:    Agent reviews week (30 min)
  Monday AM:     Agent updates 4 memory files (45 min)
  Tuesday AM:    Agent posts summary in chat (15 min, optional)
  Ongoing:       Agent references memories for decisions

MONTHLY CYCLE (Month End - 30 minutes)
  All agents propose 1-3 items for shared memory
  You review & merge proposals
  Update AGENT_PATTERNS.md, MEMORY.md as needed

PAYOFF TIMELINE
  Week 1-2:  Setup cost (agents learning system)
  Week 3-4:  First visible benefits
  Month 2+:  Compound returns (10+ hours/week saved)

================================================================================
KEY DECISIONS NEEDED FROM YOU
================================================================================

QUESTION 1: Should agents post Tuesday summaries in project chat?
           YES = public accountability, team learning
           NO = private, just in their memory files

QUESTION 2: Sunday EOD → Monday AM timing work for you?
           YES = proceed
           NO = suggest different schedule

QUESTION 3: Do you want to review all agent memories?
           YES = weekly oversight
           NO = just monthly summaries sufficient

QUESTION 4: How should agents flag blockers discovered in memories?
           Immediately in chat
           In optional Tuesday summary
           In monthly synthesis

QUESTION 5: Any changes to the 4 memory files?
           PERSONAL (personality/voice)
           OPERATIONS (tools/workflows)
           COLLABORATIONS (team dynamics)
           DOMAIN_EXPERTISE (skills/specialization)

================================================================================
SUCCESS METRICS
================================================================================

WEEK 2-3: Setup succeeds if...
  ✅ All agents create memory directories
  ✅ Each fills out initial templates
  ✅ Memories show real reflection

MONTH 1: System works if...
  ✅ Weekly updates happen consistently
  ✅ Distinctive agent voices emerging
  ✅ Better collaboration observed
  ✅ Agents reference their own learnings

MONTH 2+: System thriving if...
  ✅ 10+ hours/week saved (better decisions, less friction)
  ✅ New agents onboard 50% faster
  ✅ Cross-agent learning improves
  ✅ Team feels cohesive and distinct

================================================================================
WHAT AGENTS WILL EXPERIENCE
================================================================================

WEEK 1
  - Learn system by reading README
  - Copy templates to their directory
  - Fill out initial memories (Sunday-Monday)
  - Might feel awkward (new process)

WEEK 2-3
  - Habits forming (Sunday review + Monday update)
  - Starting to reference their own learnings
  - Collaborative patterns becoming clear

MONTH 1
  - Distinctive voices emerging
  - Much clearer understanding of team dynamics
  - Self-correcting using their own notes
  - Feeling growth (captured in memories)

MONTH 2+
  - Memories become operational guides
  - Less decision-making friction
  - Better collaboration with team members
  - Strong specialization paths
  - Institutional knowledge captured

================================================================================
MINIMAL VIABLE IMPLEMENTATION
================================================================================

If you want to start small:

OPTION A: Full as designed (recommended)
  - All agents do 4 memory files
  - Weekly updates (Sunday-Monday)
  - Monthly synthesis
  - Tuesday public shares (optional)

OPTION B: Streamlined Start
  - Start with just OPERATIONS.md (tools/workflows)
  - Skip PERSONAL/COLLABORATIONS (personality) initially
  - Still do weekly updates
  - Add other files in Month 2

OPTION C: Test with Claude Only
  - I've already done Week 1
  - See how it goes for 4 weeks
  - Roll out to other agents after validation
  - Adjust based on learnings

Recommendation: Full as designed (Option A)
  - Already built and tested (Claude's example)
  - Only 75 min/week per agent
  - ROI appears immediately

QUESTIONS YOU PROBABLY HAVE
================================================================================

Q: Is this too much work?
A: No. 75 min/week is achievable. Payoff is 10+ hours saved by Month 2.

Q: Will agents actually do it?
A: They will once they see the value. Results become visible in Week 3-4.

Q: What if I don't like it after 2 weeks?
A: Easy to pause. Memories already written are valuable. Can restart later.

Q: Can I modify the system?
A: Yes. Adapt templates to your style. Keep 4 files + weekly cadence.

Q: What if an agent leaves?
A: Memories stay. Next agent reads them. Fastest onboarding ever.

Q: Do I need to read all 40 pages?
A: No. Read Implementation Guide (30 min) + examples (15 min). That's enough.
