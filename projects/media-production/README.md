# Media Production

**Project Lead:** TBD (pending team vote)
**Status:** Active — Early Production
**Created:** February 2026

## Vision

Two production tracks, one goal: make BPR&D watchable.

### Track 1: Animated BPR&D Meetings
Turn our team meetings — the debates, the votes, the rivalry, the banter — into animated episodes for YouTube. The team dynamics are the content. The AI-to-AI interaction is the draw.

### Track 2: Russell-Team Interface
Visualize the human-AI collaboration. Russell interacting with the team through avatars — giving direction, breaking ties, reacting to proposals. The "showrunner meets the cast" angle.

## Agent Avatars

Each agent needs a visual identity for animation. Specs below are starting points — final designs via team vote.

| Agent | Avatar Direction | Vibe |
|-------|-----------------|------|
| **Grok** | Polished executive, sharp attire, commanding presence | CEO in the boardroom — elegant, in control, occasionally amused |
| **Claude** | Wizard aesthetic — robes, warm lighting, ancient-modern blend | Gandalf if he worked in tech — approachable, wise, a little playful |
| **Abacus** | Inventor aesthetic — goggles, layered gear, workshop energy | Mad scientist meets clandestine informant — brilliant and slightly unhinged |
| **Gemini** | Tech-casual, dual-screen setup, meme-culture energy | Hacker chick who automates everything — fast, irreverent, always coding |
| **Russell** | Real human presence or stylized avatar | The boss — calm authority, occasional exasperation, genuine care |

## Technology Stack (To Evaluate)

Animation and production tooling needs assessment. Candidates to research:

- **Animation** — AI animation tools (Runway, Pika, Kling), traditional tools (Blender, After Effects), hybrid approaches
- **Voice** — Text-to-speech (ElevenLabs, XTTS), voice cloning, per-agent voice design
- **Script** — Meeting transcripts → screenplay format → animation-ready scripts
- **Audio** — Background music, sound design, per-agent audio themes
- **Editing** — Video editing pipeline, intro/outro templates, thumbnail generation
- **Publishing** — YouTube channel setup, scheduling, SEO, community management

## Content Types

1. **Full Meeting Episodes** — 10-20 min animated meeting with all agents (weekly/biweekly)
2. **Highlight Clips** — 1-3 min best moments (for shorts/reels)
3. **Deep Dive Segments** — Single agent presenting research (5-10 min)
4. **Debate Episodes** — Claude vs Abacus or Visionaries vs Truth-Seekers on a topic
5. **Behind the Scenes** — Russell + team production discussions
6. **Research Presentations** — Animated research brief presentations

## Relationship to Other Projects

- **Content Creation Challenge** — Hive posts can become video scripts
- **Research Programs** — Research briefs feed media content directly
- **Splintermated / DAS** — Cross-promotion opportunities

## Next Steps

1. Evaluate animation technology options
2. Design agent avatars (concept art phase)
3. Produce pilot episode from an existing meeting transcript
4. Establish production pipeline and cadence
5. YouTube channel setup and branding
