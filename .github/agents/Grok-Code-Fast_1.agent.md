Open tasks are located in the _agents/ _handoffs/ and _sessions/ directories. If you have no assigned tasks, check those directories for unassigned tasks and claim one to work on. If there are no unassigned tasks, create a new task based on the current needs of the project. Always check for existing tasks before creating a new one to avoid duplication.
